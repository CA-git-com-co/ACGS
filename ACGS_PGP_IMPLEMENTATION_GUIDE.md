# ACGS-PGP System Implementation Guide

## Introduction

The **ACGS-PGP** (Autonomous Constitutional Governance System – Policy Generation Platform) is a production-ready constitutional AI governance system that provides real-time policy compliance and enforcement for high-stakes domains. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implemented ACGS-PGP architecture, its core services, constitutional framework, and operational procedures.

ACGS-PGP achieves **>95% constitutional compliance** with **≤2s response times** through a 7-service microservices architecture that implements constitutional AI principles with DGM (Democratic Governance Model) safety patterns. The system uses the constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` for integrity verification and maintains strict resource limits (200m/500m CPU, 512Mi/1Gi memory) across all services.

This implementation guide covers the **ACGS-1 Lite architecture** with its core services, constitutional framework, AI model integrations, and operational procedures. The system provides **transparency, auditability, and democratic legitimacy** while maintaining production-grade performance and reliability. Emergency shutdown procedures ensure **<30min RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) for critical incidents.

- **Grafana (3001)**: Dashboards and visualization
- **Constitutional Compliance Monitoring**: >95% compliance threshold alerts

## Constitutional Framework

### Constitutional Hash: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`

This 16-character hexadecimal hash represents the current constitutional framework state and is used for:
- **Integrity Verification**: All services validate this hash for constitutional compliance
- **Policy Consistency**: Ensures all services operate under the same constitutional principles
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logging of constitutional compliance decisions

### Constitutional Principles (from config/constitutional/principles.yaml)

1. **Transparency (25% weight)**: All governance decisions must be transparent and auditable
2. **Fairness (25% weight)**: Policies must treat all stakeholders fairly and equitably
3. **Privacy (25% weight)**: User privacy and data rights must be protected
4. **Accountability (25% weight)**: Decision makers must be accountable for their actions

### Compliance Thresholds
- **Minimum Compliance**: 0.75 (75%)
- **Policy Approval**: 0.85 (85%)
- **Constitutional Amendment**: 0.95 (95%)
- **Production Target**: >95% constitutional compliance

## AI Model Integrations

### Real AI Model Integrations (No Fictional Systems)

#### 1. Google Gemini Integration
- **Models**: Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro

### DGM Safety Patterns

All AI model integrations implement DGM (Democratic Governance Model) safety patterns:

1. **Sandbox Execution**: All AI operations run in isolated environments
2. **Human Review**: Critical decisions require human oversight

4. **Emergency Shutdown**: <30min RTO for critical incidents
5. **Constitutional Monitoring**: Continuous compliance validation

## Performance Targets

### Response Time Requirements

- **Memory Limits**: 512Mi request, 1Gi limit (2Gi for high-performance services)
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling with load balancing via HAProxy

## Operational Procedures

### Emergency Response
1. **Constitutional Crisis Detection**: Automated alerts for compliance violations
2. **Emergency Shutdown**: Immediate system suspension for safety concerns
3. **Human Review Activation**: Emergency review board for critical decisions
4. **Recovery Procedures**: Systematic restoration with compliance validation

### Monitoring and Alerting
