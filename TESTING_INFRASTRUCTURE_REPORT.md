## Recommendations for Coverage Improvement

### Priority 1: Core Services (Target: 80% coverage)
1. **Authentication Service** (`services/shared/auth.py`)
   - Current: 0% â†’ Target: 80%
   - Focus: Login flows, token validation, RBAC

2. **Database Layer** (`services/shared/database/`)
   - Current: 0% â†’ Target: 75%
   - Focus: Connection pooling, query optimization

3. **Service Mesh** (`services/shared/service_mesh/`)
   - Current: 30% â†’ Target: 80%
   - Focus: Load balancing, circuit breakers

### Priority 2: AI/LLM Integration (Target: 70% coverage)
1. **Multi-Model Manager** (`services/shared/multi_model_manager.py`)
2. **LLM Router Client** (`services/shared/llm_router_client.py`)
3. **Policy Synthesis Engine** (various components)

### Priority 3: Integration Tests (Target: 90% pass rate)
1. Fix import path issues in integration tests
2. Enhance mock service configurations
3. Add end-to-end workflow tests
