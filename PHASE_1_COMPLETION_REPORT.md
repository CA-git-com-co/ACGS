## 🚀 Next Phase Recommendations

Based on the outstanding success of Phase 1, I recommend proceeding with **Phase 2: Governance Workflow Implementation** as the next critical phase:

### **Phase 2 Priority: Governance API Implementation**
1. **Implement Core API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/v1/policies/create` (Governance Synthesis)
   - `/api/v1/compliance/check` (Constitutional AI)
   - `/api/v1/enforcement/validate` (Policy Governance)
   - `/api/v1/verify/policy` (Formal Verification)

2. **End-to-End Workflow Testing**:
   - Policy Creation → Constitutional Compliance → Enforcement → Verification
   - Integration with Quantumagi blockchain programs
   - Real-time governance action processing
