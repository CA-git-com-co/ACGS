# ACGS Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) - Consensus Engine Enhancement
**Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2**


**Constitutional Hash:** `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`  
**Created:** 2025-07-07T06:15:00Z  
**Feature:** Enhanced Constitutional Consensus Algorithm with Real-time Validation  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Goal
**What are we building?**
Enhance the ACGS Consensus Engine with a new real-time constitutional compliance validation algorithm that can dynamically verify consensus decisions against the constitutional framework while maintaining sub-5ms P99 latency targets.

**Constitutional Compliance Requirement:**
- [x] All consensus operations must validate constitutional hash: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- [x] All consensus decisions must include constitutional compliance validation
- [x] All consensus metrics must meet ACGS targets (P99 < 3ms for consensus operations)

---

## Why
**Why is this needed and how does it integrate with ACGS?**
The current consensus engine lacks real-time constitutional validation, which means consensus decisions could theoretically violate constitutional principles. This enhancement ensures that all multi-agent consensus decisions are constitutionally compliant before being applied, maintaining the integrity of the ACGS governance framework.

**ACGS Integration Points:**
- **Constitutional AI Service** (port 8002): Real-time validation of consensus decisions against constitutional framework
- **Multi-Agent Coordinator** (port 8008): Enhanced coordination with constitutional validation in consensus loops
- **Blackboard Service** (port 8010): Constitutional compliance status propagation across all participating agents
- **Integrity Service** (port 8002): Audit trail for all constitutional consensus validations and any violations

**Performance Requirements:**
- P99 Latency: < 3ms for constitutional consensus validation
- Throughput: > 150 RPS for consensus operations
- Constitutional Compliance Rate: 100% (zero tolerance for constitutional violations)
- Cache Hit Rate: > 90% for constitutional decision patterns

---

## What
**What will the user experience?**
Users (primarily other ACGS services and multi-agent coordination systems) will experience:
1. **Transparent Constitutional Validation**: All consensus decisions include constitutional compliance status
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate notification if a consensus decision violates constitutional principles
3. **Enhanced Audit Trail**: Complete constitutional validation history for all consensus operations
4. **Performance Assurance**: Sub-3ms constitutional validation with comprehensive metrics

**Constitutional Compliance User Experience:**
- All consensus operations return constitutional hash validation status
- All constitutional violations trigger immediate escalation and rollback
- All consensus responses include constitutional compliance metrics
- All audit events include constitutional validation details

- Blackboard Coordination: `/home/dislove/ACGS-2/services/shared/blackboard/coordination_service.py`

**ACGS Patterns to Follow:**
```python
# Constitutional compliance pattern for consensus
CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH = "cdd01ef066bc6cf2"

async def validate_consensus_constitutional_compliance(
    consensus_decision: dict, 
    participating_agents: list
) -> ConstitutionalValidationResult:
    """Validate consensus decision against constitutional framework."""
    validation_start = time.perf_counter()
    
    # Check constitutional hash
    if consensus_decision.get("constitutional_hash") != CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH:
        return ConstitutionalValidationResult(
            valid=False, 
            violation="invalid_constitutional_hash"
        )
    
    # Validate against constitutional policies
    policy_validation = await constitutional_ai_service.validate_decision(
        decision=consensus_decision,
        context={"participating_agents": participating_agents}
    )
    
    validation_time = (time.perf_counter() - validation_start) * 1000
    
    return ConstitutionalValidationResult(
        valid=policy_validation.compliant,
        validation_time_ms=validation_time,
        constitutional_hash=CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH
    )

# Performance monitoring for consensus operations
@track_latency("consensus_constitutional_validation")
async def enhanced_consensus_with_constitutional_validation(
    consensus_session: ConsensusSession
) -> ConstitutionalConsensusResult:
    # Implementation with sub-3ms constitutional validation target
    pass
```

### Gotchas
**Important considerations and potential issues:**
- **Consensus Deadlock**: Constitutional validation failures during consensus could create deadlock situations
- **Performance Impact**: Adding constitutional validation to consensus loops could impact latency
- **Cache Invalidation**: Constitutional policy changes need to invalidate consensus validation cache
- **Agent Dropout**: Agents leaving consensus mid-validation need special handling

**ACGS-Specific Gotchas:**
- **Constitutional Hash Validation**: Must validate before AND after consensus computation
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Constitutional validation must be propagated to all participating agents
- **Performance Monitoring**: Constitutional validation latency must be included in consensus timing
- **Audit Logging**: Generate separate events for consensus decisions and constitutional validations
- **Blackboard Updates**: Constitutional compliance status must be reflected in blackboard state
- **Cache Strategy**: Constitutional validation results need tenant-aware caching
- **Error Cascading**: Constitutional violations in consensus must not cascade to other services

### Anti-patterns
**What to avoid:**
- Skipping constitutional validation for "internal" consensus decisions
- Caching constitutional validation results across different constitutional policy versions
- Allowing consensus to proceed with partial constitutional validation
- Using synchronous constitutional validation in async consensus loops

**ACGS Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Bypassing constitutional validation for performance optimization
- ❌ Hardcoding consensus timeout values without constitutional validation consideration
- ❌ Skipping audit event generation for constitutional validation steps
- ❌ Using blocking I/O during constitutional validation in consensus critical path
- ❌ Ignoring constitutional validation latency in consensus performance metrics
- ❌ Missing rollback mechanisms for constitutional compliance failures

## Validation

### Level 1: Syntax & Style
**Basic code quality checks:**
```bash
# ACGS-specific validation commands
ruff check services/core/consensus_engine/ --fix
mypy services/core/consensus_engine/
python tools/validation/constitutional_compliance_validator.py --service consensus_engine
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests
**Comprehensive unit testing:**
```bash
# Constitutional compliance tests
pytest tests/unit/consensus_engine/ -v --constitutional-compliance

# Performance tests for constitutional consensus
pytest tests/unit/consensus_engine/ -v --performance -k "test_constitutional_consensus_latency"

# Multi-agent constitutional coordination tests
pytest tests/unit/consensus_engine/ -v --multi-agent-coordination -k "test_constitutional"
```

**Required Test Patterns:**
```python
class TestConstitutionalConsensusEngine(ConstitutionalTestCase):
    
    @pytest.mark.constitutional
    def test_constitutional_consensus_compliance(self):
        """Test constitutional compliance in consensus operations."""
        session = ConstitutionalConsensusSession(
            algorithm_type=ConsensusAlgorithmType.CONSTITUTIONAL_PRIORITY,
            participating_agents=["ethics-001", "legal-001", "operational-001"],
            consensus_topic="test_constitutional_decision"
        )
        
        result = await self.consensus_engine.execute_constitutional_consensus(session)

        blackboard_status = await self.get_blackboard_constitutional_status(session.session_id)
        assert blackboard_status["constitutional_compliant"] == result.constitutional_validation.valid
    
    @pytest.mark.constitutional
    def test_constitutional_violation_handling(self):

        with pytest.raises(ConstitutionalComplianceError):
            await self.consensus_engine.execute_constitutional_consensus(session)
        
        # Verify violation was logged

        assert len(violation_events) > 0
        assert violation_events[0]["constitutional_hash"] == CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH
```

### Level 3: Integration Tests
**Service integration validation:**
```bash
# ACGS constitutional consensus integration tests
pytest tests/integration/consensus_engine/ -v

# End-to-end constitutional consensus with multi-agent coordination
python tests/integration/test_constitutional_consensus_end_to_end.py

# Multi-service constitutional consensus coordination
python tests/integration/test_multi_service_constitutional_consensus.py
```

### Level 4: Performance Validation
**Performance and constitutional compliance validation:**
```bash
# Performance regression tests for constitutional consensus
python tests/performance/test_constitutional_consensus_performance.py

# Constitutional compliance monitoring during load
python tools/monitoring/constitutional_consensus_monitor.py --duration 60

# Load testing constitutional consensus with validation
python tests/load_testing/test_constitutional_consensus_load.py --rps 150 --duration 30
```
