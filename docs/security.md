# ACGS-PGP Security Considerations

Security is a critical aspect of the AI Compliance Governance System - Policy Generation Platform (ACGS-PGP). This document outlines key security considerations, best practices, and measures implemented or planned for the system.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Authentication:**
    *   All user access to the system (frontend and backend APIs) is protected by an authentication mechanism.
    *   The `auth_service` handles user registration, login, and issues JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
    *   Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt` (via `passlib`) before being stored in the database.
*   **Authorization:**
    *   JWTs are used to authorize requests to protected API endpoints.
    *   Backend services validate JWTs on incoming requests.
    *   (Future Enhancement) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access to certain functionalities or data based on user roles (e.g., admin, policy creator, auditor).

## 2. Secure Communication

*   **HTTPS/TLS:**
    *   All external communication (client to frontend, frontend to API gateway/backend services) should be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
    *   In a Kubernetes deployment, TLS termination can be handled at the Ingress controller or LoadBalancer level.
    *   In Docker Compose (for local dev), Nginx can be configured for HTTPS if a self-signed certificate is used, though typically HTTP is used locally.
*   **Inter-service Communication:**
    *   Communication between backend microservices within the Kubernetes cluster can be secured using network policies and potentially a service mesh (like Istio or Linkerd) for mutual TLS (mTLS).

## 3. Data Security

*   **Data at Rest:**
    *   Sensitive data in the PostgreSQL database (e.g., user credentials, private policies) should be protected.
    *   Database access credentials should be stored securely (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, environment variables from a secure source).
    *   Consider database encryption features provided by the cloud provider or PostgreSQL itself for highly sensitive data.
*   **Data in Transit:** (Covered by HTTPS/TLS and mTLS)
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   Application secrets (API keys, JWT secret keys, database passwords) must NOT be hardcoded in source code.
    *   Use environment variables, loaded from `.env` files (for local development, ignored by Git) or Kubernetes Secrets (for production).
    *   The `auth_service`'s `SECRET_KEY` for JWT signing is critical and must be managed securely.

## 4. Input Validation

*   All incoming data to API endpoints (request bodies, query parameters, headers) must be rigorously validated.
*   FastAPI uses Pydantic schemas for automatic request validation, which helps prevent many common injection-type vulnerabilities.
*   Frontend should also perform client-side validation for better UX, but server-side validation is paramount.

## 5. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)

*   **Code Reviews:** All code contributions should undergo a security review to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies (Python packages, npm packages) for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`, `npm audit`, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot.
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools (e.g., Bandit for Python, ESLint security plugins for JavaScript) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** (Future Enhancement) Consider DAST tools for testing the running application in a test environment.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Services and users should only have the permissions necessary to perform their intended functions.

## 6. Infrastructure Security (Kubernetes)

*   **Network Policies:** Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic flow between pods, ensuring services can only communicate with those they need to.
*   **Pod Security Policies / Pod Security Admission:** Enforce security best practices for pods (e.g., disallow privileged containers, restrict hostPath mounts).
*   **RBAC for Kubernetes API:** Ensure Kubernetes RBAC is configured to limit access to the Kubernetes API itself.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Kubernetes cluster and its components updated with security patches.
*   **Image Security:**
    *   Use official and verified base images for Docker containers.
    *   Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
    *   Minimize layers and unnecessary software in images.

## 7. Audit Logging

*   The `integrity_service` (and other services) generate audit logs for significant events (e.g., login attempts, policy creation/modification, verification requests).
*   These logs are crucial for security monitoring, incident response, and compliance.
*   Ensure audit logs are stored securely and are tamper-evident if possible.

## 8. Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities

*   **OWASP Top 10:** Be mindful of common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., Injection, Broken Authentication, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Insecure Deserialization) and apply countermeasures.
    *   FastAPI's use of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy helps mitigate SQL injection if used correctly.
    *   React's JSX encoding helps prevent XSS, but care is needed with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
    *   Ensure proper configuration for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in FastAPI services.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints (especially authentication and public-facing ones) to protect against brute-force attacks and DoS. This can be done at the API Gateway level or within services.

## 9. Incident Response Plan (Future Consideration)

*   Develop a plan for responding to security incidents, including identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

## 10. Regular Security Audits

*   (Future Enhancement) Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing by independent security professionals.
