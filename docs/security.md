# ACGS-PGP Security Architecture

Security is paramount in the AI Compliance Governance System - Policy Generation Platform (ACGS-PGP), especially given its role in constitutional AI governance. This document outlines comprehensive security measures implemented across all Phase 1-3 components including constitutional governance, cryptographic integrity, and formal verification security.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization Framework

### **Multi-Layered Authentication**

- **JWT Token System:** Secure JSON Web Token implementation with configurable expiration and refresh mechanisms
- **Password Security:** bcrypt hashing with salt rounds for password storage
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling with automatic timeout and invalidation
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Optional MFA for Constitutional Council members and administrators

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - IMPLEMENTED**

- **Admin Role:** Full system access, user management, and configuration control
- **Policy Manager Role:** Policy creation, modification, and constitutional principle management
- **Auditor Role:** Read-only access to audit logs, compliance reports, and verification results
- **Constitutional Council Role:** Special permissions for constitutional amendments, voting, and governance decisions
- **Service-to-Service Authentication:** Internal service tokens for secure inter-service communication

### **Constitutional Governance Security**

- **Amendment Authorization:** Strict authorization for constitutional amendment proposals and voting
- **Democratic Validation:** Cryptographic validation of Constitutional Council voting processes
- **Governance Audit Trail:** Complete audit trail for all constitutional governance decisions
- **Principle Access Control:** Granular access control for constitutional principle management

## 2. Cryptographic Integrity (PGP Assurance) - PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTED

### **Digital Signature Framework**

- **PGP/GPG Integration:** All constitutional versions and policy artifacts are digitally signed using PGP/GPG
- **Key Management:** Secure key generation, storage, and rotation with HSM (Hardware Security Module) integration
- **Signature Verification:** Automatic verification of digital signatures for all constitutional documents
- **Non-Repudiation:** Cryptographic proof of authorship and integrity for all governance decisions

### **Cryptographic Hashing and Integrity Chains**

- **SHA3-256 Hashing:** Advanced cryptographic hashing for all data integrity verification
- **Merkle Tree Structures:** Hierarchical hash trees for efficient integrity verification of large datasets
- **Hash Chain Validation:** Continuous integrity validation through cryptographic hash chains
- **Tamper Detection:** Immediate detection of any unauthorized modifications to constitutional data

### **Timestamping and Audit Trail**

- **RFC 3161 Timestamping:** Compliant timestamping for all constitutional amendments and policy changes
- **Immutable Audit Logs:** Cryptographically secured audit logs with integrity verification
- **Constitutional Version Control:** Complete versioning of constitutional principles with cryptographic integrity
- **Governance Decision Provenance:** Cryptographic proof of governance decision lineage

## 3. Secure Communication Architecture

### **Transport Layer Security**

- **TLS 1.3 Enforcement:** Latest TLS protocol for all external communications
- **Certificate Management:** Automated certificate provisioning and renewal
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy:** Ephemeral key exchange for enhanced security
- **HSTS Implementation:** HTTP Strict Transport Security for browser protection

### **Inter-Service Security**

- **Service Mesh mTLS:** Mutual TLS authentication between all microservices
- **Network Segmentation:** Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for traffic isolation
- **API Gateway Security:** Centralized security enforcement at the API gateway level
- **Internal Token Validation:** Secure service-to-service authentication tokens

## 4. Data Protection and Privacy

### **Data at Rest Security**

- **Database Encryption:** PostgreSQL encryption at rest with key management
- **Constitutional Data Protection:** Special encryption for constitutional principles and amendments
- **Backup Encryption:** Encrypted backups with secure key storage
- **Key Rotation:** Regular rotation of encryption keys with zero-downtime

### **Data in Transit Protection**

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Complete encryption from client to database
- **API Payload Encryption:** Additional encryption for sensitive API payloads
- **Constitutional Amendment Security:** Special protection for constitutional amendment data
- **LLM Communication Security:** Secure communication with external LLM services

### **Secrets and Configuration Management**

- **Kubernetes Secrets:** Secure storage of sensitive configuration data
- **Environment Separation:** Strict separation of development, staging, and production secrets
- **Secret Rotation:** Automated rotation of API keys, database passwords, and JWT secrets
- **HSM Integration:** Hardware Security Module for critical key storage

## 4. Input Validation

- All incoming data to API endpoints (request bodies, query parameters, headers) must be rigorously validated.
- FastAPI uses Pydantic schemas for automatic request validation, which helps prevent many common injection-type vulnerabilities.
- Frontend should also perform client-side validation for better UX, but server-side validation is paramount.

## 5. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)

- **Code Reviews:** All code contributions should undergo a security review to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies (Python packages, npm packages) for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`, `npm audit`, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot.
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools (e.g., Bandit for Python, ESLint security plugins for JavaScript) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** (Future Enhancement) Consider DAST tools for testing the running application in a test environment.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Services and users should only have the permissions necessary to perform their intended functions.

## 6. Infrastructure Security (Kubernetes)

- **Network Policies:** Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic flow between pods, ensuring services can only communicate with those they need to.
- **Pod Security Policies / Pod Security Admission:** Enforce security best practices for pods (e.g., disallow privileged containers, restrict hostPath mounts).
- **RBAC for Kubernetes API:** Ensure Kubernetes RBAC is configured to limit access to the Kubernetes API itself.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep the Kubernetes cluster and its components updated with security patches.
- **Image Security:**
  - Use official and verified base images for Docker containers.
  - Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
  - Minimize layers and unnecessary software in images.

## 7. Audit Logging

- The `integrity_service` (and other services) generate audit logs for significant events (e.g., login attempts, policy creation/modification, verification requests).
- These logs are crucial for security monitoring, incident response, and compliance.
- Ensure audit logs are stored securely and are tamper-evident if possible.

## 8. Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities

- **OWASP Top 10:** Be mindful of common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., Injection, Broken Authentication, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Insecure Deserialization) and apply countermeasures.
  - FastAPI's use of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy helps mitigate SQL injection if used correctly.
  - React's JSX encoding helps prevent XSS, but care is needed with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
  - Ensure proper configuration for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in FastAPI services.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints (especially authentication and public-facing ones) to protect against brute-force attacks and DoS. This can be done at the API Gateway level or within services.

## 9. Incident Response Plan (Future Consideration)

- Develop a plan for responding to security incidents, including identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

## 10. Regular Security Audits

- (Future Enhancement) Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing by independent security professionals.
