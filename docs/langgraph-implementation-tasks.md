   - Add progress visualization for amendment workflow stages
   - Include stakeholder engagement metrics and voting status

**Success Criteria:**
- End-to-end amendment workflow completion with stakeholder engagement
- 50% reduction in amendment processing time vs manual processes
- Real-time dashboard shows live amendment status
- All stakeholder roles can participate in workflow

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Pattern
Follow established ACGS-PGP development pattern:
1. **codebase-retrieval** → gather detailed information
2. **detailed planning** → create implementation plan
3. **str-replace-editor** → implement code changes
4. **testing** → validate functionality
5. **documentation updates** → update relevant docs

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing ACGS-PGP functionality
- Use FastAPI async/await patterns throughout
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow Pydantic v2.0+ validation standards
- Integrate with existing authentication and RBAC systems

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1**: Successful API response with all LangGraph capabilities enabled
- **Phase 2**: End-to-end amendment workflow with stakeholder engagement
- **Phase 3**: >99.9% policy synthesis success rate with multi-model fallback
- **Phase 4**: Real-time constitutional compliance monitoring with automated alerts

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all new LangGraph workflow components
- Integration tests for cross-service communication
- End-to-end tests for complete amendment workflows
- Performance tests for multi-model LLM integration
- Security tests for new API endpoints and workflows

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Task 16 (LangGraph Foundation Setup)
2. Validate basic functionality before proceeding to Phase 2
3. Maintain continuous integration testing throughout implementation
4. Document all configuration changes and new dependencies
5. Update deployment guides for production readiness
