### 1.6 Monitoring & Observability

- [x] **Monitoring Setup**: Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting configured and operational.
- [x] **Logging**: Centralized logging configured with appropriate retention policies.
- [x] **Alerting**: Critical alerts for constitutional compliance, performance, and security are firing correctly for test cases.

## 2. Operational Readiness

- [ ] **Runbook Availability**: Comprehensive runbooks for common operational procedures (e.g., scaling, troubleshooting, recovery) are available and reviewed.
- [ ] **On-Call Rotation**: On-call rotation established and team members trained.
- [ ] **Incident Management**: Incident response plan defined and communicated.
- [ ] **Disaster Recovery Plan**: DR plan documented and tested.

## 3. Stakeholder Sign-off

All relevant stakeholders must review and sign off on the production readiness.

- [ ] **Technical Lead**: \***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*** Date: **\_\_\_\_**
- [ ] **Product Owner**: \***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*** Date: **\_\_\_\_**
- [ ] **Security Officer**: \***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*** Date: **\_\_\_\_**
- [ ] **Legal/Compliance**: \***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*** Date: **\_\_\_\_**
- [ ] **Operations Lead**: \***\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*** Date: **\_\_\_\_**

## 4. Rollback Criteria and Emergency Procedures

### 4.1 Rollback Criteria

A rollback will be initiated if any of the following conditions are met post-deployment:

- Constitutional compliance score drops below 90% for more than 10 minutes.
- P95 response times exceed 5 seconds for more than 5 minutes.
- Throughput drops by more than 50% from baseline for more than 5 minutes.
- Critical security alerts are triggered.
- Unrecoverable data corruption is detected.
- Core service health checks fail consistently.

### 4.2 Rollback Procedures

Refer to the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed rollback steps. Typically involves switching traffic back to the previous stable version (blue-green deployment) or scaling down the new deployment.

### 4.3 Emergency Procedures

Refer to the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for emergency shutdown procedures. The goal is to achieve an RTO of <30 minutes.

## 5. Post-Deployment Activities

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor performance metrics against targets.
- [ ] **Security Audits**: Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- [ ] **Compliance Reporting**: Generate regular reports on constitutional compliance.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
