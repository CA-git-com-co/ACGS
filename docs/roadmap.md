    *   Admin panel for user management.
    *   Define and assign roles (e.g., Admin, Policy Creator, Auditor, Viewer).
    *   Implement RBAC across all services.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] Real Policy Generation (`pgc_service`):**
    *   Integrated with an actual LLM (e.g., via OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers, local Ollama).
    *   Developed sophisticated prompting strategies for policy generation.
    *   Allows selection of principles/guidelines to inform generation.
    *   Implemented policy templates.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] Advanced Policy Editing & Versioning (`pgc_service`):**
    *   Rich text editor for policy documents.
    *   Tracks policy versions and history.
    *   Allows comparison between versions.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] AlphaEvolve Integration (`fv_service`):**
    *   Developed concrete integrations with the AlphaEvolve formal verification engine.
    *   Defined a clear process for translating policies/system designs into verifiable models.
    *   API endpoints to submit verification tasks and retrieve results.
    *   Frontend UI to manage verification requests and display results.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] Governance Structure Implementation (`gs_service`):**
    *   Developed models and APIs for defining organizational roles, responsibilities, and decision-making workflows related to AI.
    *   Allows mapping of policies to these governance structures.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] Enhanced Data Integrity (`integrity_service`):**
    *   Implemented mechanisms for data signing or hashing for key artifacts (policies, verification results).
    *   Secure and more detailed audit logging capabilities.
    *   API for querying audit logs with filtering.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] Frontend Enhancements:**
    *   Improved UI/UX across all pages.
    *   Interactive dashboards with visualizations.
    *   Notifications system.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] Testing Coverage:**
    *   Increased unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage for all services.
*   **[LARGELY COMPLETE] CI/CD Pipeline Improvements:**
    *   Automated deployment to staging environments.
    *   Security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency checks).

## Phase 3: Formal Verification & Production Readiness (IN PROGRESS)

This phase focuses on solidifying formal verification capabilities and preparing the system for production deployment.

*   **[IN PROGRESS] Formal Verification Service (`fv_service`):**
    *   Current Status: Core models and logic for formal verification exist within the system, but a dedicated, robust service for external consumption and integration is still under development.
    *   Projected Timeline: Q4 2024 - Q1 2025
*   **[PENDING] Monitoring & Logging:**
    *   Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki).
    *   Set up monitoring and alerting (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
*   **[PENDING] Scalability & Performance Optimization:**
    *   Load testing and performance tuning of services.
    *   Optimize database queries and resource usage.
*   **[PENDING] Advanced Security Hardening:**
    *   Regular penetration testing.
    *   Implement advanced security measures based on audits (e.g., WAF, IDS/IPS).
*   **[PENDING] Compliance Automation & Reporting:**
    *   Tools to help automate compliance checks against policies.
    *   Generate compliance reports.
*   **[PENDING] External System Integrations:**
    *   Integrate with other enterprise systems (e.g., GRC tools, document management systems).
*   **[PENDING] User Feedback & Iteration:**
    *   Gather user feedback from pilot deployments and iterate on features.
*   **[PENDING] Comprehensive Documentation:**
    *   Detailed API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
    *   Updated user and administrator manuals.

## Recent Project Updates

*   **Project Reorganization:** The project underwent a significant reorganization to improve modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
*   **Pydantic v2.0+ Migration:** All Pydantic models have been migrated to Pydantic v2.0+ for improved performance and features.
*   **TaskMaster Integration:** TaskMaster has been integrated for enhanced project management, task tracking, and workflow automation.

## Future Ideas (Beyond Core Roadmap)

*   **AI-Assisted Policy Analysis:** Use NLP to analyze existing policies for gaps or inconsistencies.
*   **Multi-language Support for Policies.**
*   **Support for Different Regulatory Frameworks:** Templates and guidelines specific to GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.
*   **Collaborative Policy Editing Features.**
*   **Risk Management Module Integration.**

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated based on project progress, feedback, and evolving requirements.
