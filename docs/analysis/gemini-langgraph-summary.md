### 2. Multi-Model LLM Architecture

- **Role-Based Model Selection**: Specialized models for different tasks (query generation, reflection, answer synthesis)
- **Configurable Fallback Strategy**: Automatic model switching with retry mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Temperature and retry configuration per model role

### 3. Iterative Refinement Patterns

- **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Structured reflection to identify information gaps
- **Conditional Workflow Routing**: Dynamic next-step determination based on analysis results
- **Loop Control**: Configurable maximum iterations with quality thresholds

### 4. Real-time Frontend Integration

- **Event-Driven Updates**: Live workflow monitoring with structured event processing
- **Activity Timeline**: User-friendly visualization of complex multi-step processes
- **Configurable Processing**: User-controlled effort levels affecting workflow intensity

## Technical Architecture Insights

### 1. State Management Best Practices

```python
# Proven pattern from analysis
class ConstitutionalCouncilState(TypedDict):
    amendment_proposal: dict
    stakeholder_feedback: Annotated[list, operator.add]  # Automatic accumulation
    constitutional_analysis: dict
    refinement_iterations: int
    is_constitutional: bool
```

### 2. Multi-Model Configuration Strategy

```python
# Configurable model roles with fallbacks
models = {
    "constitutional_prompting": "gemini-2.5-pro",
    "policy_synthesis": "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "conflict_resolution": "gemini-2.5-flash"
}
fallback_models = {
    "constitutional_prompting": "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "policy_synthesis": "gemini-1.5-pro",
    "conflict_resolution": "gemini-2.0-flash"
}
```

### 3. Structured Output Validation

```python
# Pydantic models for LLM output validation
class ConstitutionalAnalysis(BaseModel):
    is_constitutional: bool = Field(description="Constitutional compliance status")
    violations: List[str] = Field(description="Identified constitutional violations")
    recommendations: List[str] = Field(description="Improvement recommendations")
```

## Deployment and Infrastructure Patterns

### 1. Production-Ready Container Architecture

- Health checks with proper retry logic
- Service dependency management with health conditions
- Environment-based configuration management

### 2. Redis/PostgreSQL Integration

- State persistence for long-running workflows
