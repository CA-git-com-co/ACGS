# ACGS-PGP System Architecture

## 1. Overview

The AI Compliance Governance System - Policy Generation Platform (ACGS-PGP) is a comprehensive microservices-based architecture implementing constitutional AI governance through three development phases. The system facilitates the creation, management, verification, and audit of AI governance policies with constitutional grounding, formal verification, and cryptographic integrity.

## 4. Communication Flow

*   **API Gateway (Conceptual):** While not explicitly implemented as a separate service in the initial setup, in a production environment, an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Traefik, Nginx Plus) would typically sit in front of the backend microservices. It would handle:
    *   Request routing to the appropriate service.
    *   Load balancing.
    *   Authentication (validating JWT tokens).
    *   Rate limiting.
    *   SSL termination.
    *   For the current setup, the frontend `apiClient` and Docker Compose/Kubernetes service definitions manage direct service communication or routing.

*   **Inter-service Communication:**
    *   Services communicate with each other via RESTful APIs (HTTP/JSON).
    *   Synchronous communication is typical for direct requests.
    *   Asynchronous communication (e.g., via a message queue like RabbitMQ or Kafka) could be introduced for tasks like triggering formal verification or complex policy generation steps to improve responsiveness, but is not part of the initial core design.
    (Future Enhancement: A detailed sequence diagram illustrating key interaction flows will be added in a future update.)
