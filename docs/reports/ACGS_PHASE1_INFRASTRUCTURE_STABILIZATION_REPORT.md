| ec_service | 8006 | ‚ùå Failed | - | Connection refused | Up 1s (starting) | Missing dependency: tenacity |

## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Performance
- **Target:** <200ms
- **Results:** All responding services meet target
- **Fastest:** fv_service (5ms)
- **Slowest:** gs_service (47ms)
- **Average:** 17ms across healthy services

### Service Availability
- **Current Uptime:** 71.4% (5/7 services operational)
- **Target Uptime:** >99.5%
- **Gap:** 28.1% improvement needed

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. PGC Service - Python Import Error (CRITICAL)
```
NameError: name 'AsyncSession' is not defined. Did you mean: 'MockAsyncSession'?
File: /app/app/core/incremental_compiler.py, line 909
```
**Impact:** Policy Governance Compiler completely non-functional  
**Fix Required:** Add proper SQLAlchemy AsyncSession import

### 2. EC Service - Missing Dependencies (CRITICAL)
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tenacity'
File: /app/shared/common/http_clients.py, line 15
```
**Impact:** Evolutionary Computation service cannot start  
**Fix Required:** Install tenacity package in Docker container

### 3. GS Service - Dependency Connectivity (HIGH)
```
"dependencies": {
  "ac_service": {"status": "unhealthy", "error": "All connection attempts failed"},
  "integrity_service": {"status": "unhealthy", "error": "All connection attempts failed"}
}
```
**Impact:** Governance Synthesis service reports dependency failures despite services being accessible  
**Fix Required:** Update service discovery configuration

### 4. Auth Service - Health Check Mismatch (MEDIUM)
- Service responds correctly (HTTP 200)
- Container marked as "unhealthy"
- **Fix Required:** Review Docker health check configuration

### 5. AC Service - Memory Usage (LOW)
- Memory usage: 88% (above threshold)
- Service functional but may impact performance
- **Fix Required:** Memory optimization or threshold adjustment

## Cross-Service Communication Analysis

### ‚úÖ Working Communications
- Auth service endpoints accessible
- AC service API endpoints accessible  
- Integrity service API endpoints accessible
- Basic HTTP connectivity established

### ‚ùå Failing Communications
- GS service cannot connect to AC service (despite AC being accessible)
- GS service cannot connect to Integrity service (despite Integrity being accessible)
- Service discovery mechanism appears misconfigured

## Infrastructure Components Status

### Docker Environment
- ‚úÖ Docker daemon running
- ‚úÖ 11 total containers running
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database healthy (port 5433)
- ‚úÖ Redis instances healthy (ports 6380, 6381)
- ‚úÖ Alembic runner completed

### Network Configuration
- ‚úÖ Port mappings correct (8000-8006)
- ‚úÖ External connectivity working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Internal service-to-service connectivity issues

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 hours)
1. **Fix PGC Service Import Error**
   ```bash
   # Add to pgc_service/app/core/incremental_compiler.py
   from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
   ```

2. **Fix EC Service Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Add to ec_service/requirements.txt or Dockerfile
   tenacity>=8.0.0
   ```

3. **Restart Failed Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart pgc_service ec_service
   ```

### Phase 2: Configuration Fixes (2-4 hours)
1. **Fix GS Service Connectivity**
   - Update service URLs in environment variables
   - Use internal Docker network names instead of localhost
   - Verify service discovery configuration

2. **Fix Auth Service Health Check**
   - Review Docker health check command
   - Align container health with service health

3. **Optimize AC Service Memory**
   - Implement memory optimization
   - Adjust monitoring thresholds

### Phase 3: Validation (1 hour)
1. **Re-run Infrastructure Validation**
2. **Test All Cross-Service Communications**
3. **Perform Load Testing**
4. **Generate Final Readiness Report**

## Success Criteria for Phase 2 Readiness

### Must Have (Blocking)
- [ ] All 7 services responding with HTTP 200
- [ ] All services showing "healthy" status
- [ ] Cross-service communication working
- [ ] Response times <200ms maintained

### Should Have (Important)
- [ ] Container health checks aligned
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
- [ ] Service discovery working
- [ ] Basic load testing passed

### Nice to Have (Enhancement)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Performance optimization completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Estimated Timeline

- **Critical Fixes:** 1-2 hours
- **Configuration Fixes:** 2-4 hours  
- **Validation & Testing:** 1 hour
- **Total Estimated Time:** 4-7 hours

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- PGC service failure blocks policy compilation
- EC service failure blocks AlphaEvolve integration
- Service discovery issues may cascade

### Medium Risk
- Memory issues may cause performance degradation
- Health check mismatches may cause monitoring issues

### Low Risk
- Minor configuration adjustments needed
- Documentation updates required

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. Prioritize critical service fixes (PGC, EC)
2. Implement proper dependency management
3. Standardize service configuration

### Short-term
1. Implement comprehensive health checks
2. Add service discovery mechanism
3. Optimize resource usage

### Long-term
1. Implement monitoring and alerting
2. Add automated testing pipeline
3. Create disaster recovery procedures

## Conclusion

The ACGS-PGP infrastructure is **71.4% operational** with 4 out of 7 services healthy. While the foundation is solid with Docker, database, and core services working, **critical fixes are required** for PGC and EC services before Phase 2 AlphaEvolve integration can proceed.

The identified issues are **well-defined and fixable** within the estimated 4-7 hour timeframe. Once resolved, the infrastructure will be ready for Phase 2 implementation.

**Next Action:** Implement critical fixes for PGC and EC services as outlined in the immediate action plan.
