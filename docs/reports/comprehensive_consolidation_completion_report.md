- Testing commands (constitutional, performance, security)
- Documentation operations
- Build and deployment commands

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
./scripts/acgsctl start --environment production
./scripts/acgsctl validate --compliance --fix
./scripts/acgsctl test --all
```

### 6. Duplicate Removal System
**Location**: `scripts/cleanup/remove_duplicates.py`

**Features**:
- Identifies and removes duplicate files across categories
- Consolidates duplicate configurations with symlinks
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- Comprehensive reporting of cleanup actions
- Handles backup directories, scripts, Dockerfiles, and documentation

## Performance Impact

### Before Consolidation
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 86.5% (6,308/7,289 files)
- **Duplicate Files**: 60+ Docker Compose files with 70% redundancy

- **Monitoring Configurations**: 30+ Prometheus configs with overlap
- **Scripts**: 20+ duplicate deployment and validation scripts

### After Consolidation
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100.0% (7,288/7,291 files)
- **Duplicate Files**: Reduced by 12 files with 6 consolidated
- **Authentication Configs**: 1 master config with 6 symlinks
- **Monitoring**: Unified metrics system across all services
