# ACGS-1 Reasoning Models Deployment Status Report

**Date**: June 20, 2025  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - GPU COMPATIBILITY ISSUE**  
**Reporter**: Augment Agent

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

The deployment of the ACGS-1 Advanced Reasoning Models (NVIDIA AceReason-Nemotron-1.1-7B, Microsoft Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and NVIDIA Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-VL-8B-V1) has encountered a critical GPU compatibility issue that prevents model deployment on the current hardware.

## üö® **Critical Issue Identified**

### **GPU Compatibility Problem**

- **Hardware**: NVIDIA B200 GPU with 183GB VRAM
- **CUDA Capability**: sm_100 (Blackwell architecture)
- **PyTorch Support**: Only supports up to sm_90
- **Error**: `RuntimeError: CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device`

### **Root Cause**

The NVIDIA B200 GPU is a very new architecture (Blackwell) with CUDA capability sm_100, but the current PyTorch 2.7.0 installation only supports CUDA capabilities up to sm_90. This creates a fundamental incompatibility preventing any CUDA operations.

## üìä **System Status**

### ‚úÖ **Successfully Completed**

- [x] System requirements verification (2.2TB RAM, 183GB VRAM, sufficient storage)
- [x] vLLM 0.9.1 installation and basic import
- [x] PyTorch 2.7.0 installation with CUDA support
- [x] CUDA toolkit installation
- [x] Environment setup and library path configuration
- [x] Deployment scripts creation and configuration

### ‚ùå **Blocked Items**

- [ ] NVIDIA AceReason-Nemotron-1.1-7B model deployment
- [ ] Microsoft Phi-4-mini-reasoning model deployment
- [ ] NVIDIA Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-VL-8B-V1 model deployment
- [ ] Model health checks and performance validation
- [ ] Production model serving

## üîß **Recommended Solutions**

### **Immediate Actions (Priority 1)**

1. **Upgrade PyTorch to Nightly Build**

   ```bash
   pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu126
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use CPU-Only Mode for Testing**

   - Modify deployment scripts to use `--device cpu`
   - Test model loading and basic functionality
   - Validate integration without GPU acceleration

3. **Alternative Hardware**
   - Use NVIDIA A100 or H100 GPUs (sm_80/sm_90) for production deployment
   - These are fully supported by current PyTorch versions

### **Long-term Solutions (Priority 2)**

1. **Wait for Official PyTorch Support**

   - Monitor PyTorch releases for sm_100 support
   - Expected in upcoming PyTorch 2.8+ releases

2. **Custom PyTorch Build**
   - Build PyTorch from source with sm_100 support
   - Requires significant development time and expertise

## üìà **Impact Assessment**

### **Business Impact**

- **Severity**: High - Blocks production deployment
- **Timeline**: Deployment delayed until GPU compatibility resolved
- **Workaround**: CPU-only testing possible for development

### **Technical Impact**

- All model inference blocked on GPU
- Testing and development can continue with CPU mode
- Integration testing and CI/CD pipeline can proceed
- Documentation and training materials unaffected

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate (Today)**

1. Continue with comprehensive testing using CPU mode
2. Validate integration tests and CI/CD pipeline
3. Complete documentation and training materials
4. Test model loading and basic functionality

### **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**

1. Attempt PyTorch nightly build installation
2. Explore alternative GPU hardware options
3. Implement CPU-based testing infrastructure
4. Complete all non-GPU dependent tasks

### **Medium-term (1-2 months)**

1. Monitor PyTorch releases for sm_100 support
2. Plan hardware upgrade if needed
3. Prepare for production deployment once compatibility resolved

## üìã **Task List Status Update**

Based on this issue, the task priorities should be adjusted:

### **Continue with High Priority**

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing (CPU mode)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline validation
- ‚úÖ Documentation enhancement
- ‚úÖ Team training and onboarding

### **Postponed Until GPU Issue Resolved**

- ‚è∏Ô∏è GPU-based model deployment
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Performance benchmarking with GPU
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Production load testing
