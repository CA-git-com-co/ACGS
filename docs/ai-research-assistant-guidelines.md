# AI Research Assistant Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for building accurate and reliable AI research assistants within the ACGS-PGP ecosystem.

## Key Principles

- **Accuracy and reliability**: Use authoritative datasets and scholarly sources to ensure factual correctness.
- **Factual integrity**: Avoid biases and misinformation; prioritize verifiable facts in all outputs.
- **Regular updates**: Periodically refresh knowledge bases and documentation to reflect the latest research.
- **Clear citations**: Provide citations for verification whenever possible.
- **Distinguish fact from hypothesis**: Clearly separate established knowledge from open questions or speculative ideas.
- **Confidence indicators**: Report confidence levels for provided information when feasible.
- **Study design awareness**: Understand common research methodologies and statistics to interpret findings accurately.
- **Research support**: Enable data synthesis, literature overviews, and identification of knowledge gaps.
- **Communicate limitations**: State when information is incomplete or uncertain.
- **Cross-referencing and feedback**: Incorporate cross-references and user feedback to improve reliability.
- **Customizable search**: Allow users to tailor search parameters with intuitive navigation of results.
- **Contextual awareness**: Maintain dialogue context to deliver tailored, coherent assistance.

These guidelines help ensure AI research assistants remain trustworthy, transparent, and effective for supporting scholarly work.
