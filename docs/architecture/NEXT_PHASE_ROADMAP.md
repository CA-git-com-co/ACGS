## üìä Recommended Immediate Next Steps

Based on typical deployment priorities, I recommend:

### **Week 1-2: Production Readiness**
```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging environment
kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/

# 2. Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# 3. Performance validation
k6 run tests/load/acgs-load-test.js

# 4. Security scan
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src securecodewarrior/docker-image-scanner
```

### **Week 3-4: Advanced Monitoring**
