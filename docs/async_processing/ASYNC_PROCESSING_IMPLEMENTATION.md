## üîß Technical Architecture

### Job Processing Flow

1. **Job Submission**: Client submits job with type, payload, and priority
2. **Queue Management**: Jobs queued by priority (CRITICAL > HIGH > NORMAL > LOW)
3. **Worker Assignment**: Available workers pick up jobs from priority queues
4. **Processing**: Job handlers execute business logic asynchronously
5. **Status Updates**: Real-time status tracking and metrics collection
6. **Completion**: Results stored and optional callbacks triggered

### Priority System

- **CRITICAL**: Constitutional violations, security alerts
- **HIGH**: Compliance checks, urgent governance actions
- **NORMAL**: Policy synthesis, standard workflows
- **LOW**: Monitoring, data exports, maintenance tasks

### Error Handling & Resilience

- **Automatic Retries**: Up to 3 retries with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable job timeouts (default: 300s)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed jobs don't affect other processing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed jobs preserved for analysis
