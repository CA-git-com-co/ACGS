## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Infrastructure
1. [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL database
2. [ ] Deploy Redis cache
3. [ ] Configure networking
4. [ ] Verify connectivity

### Phase 2: Core Services
1. [ ] Deploy Authentication Service
2. [ ] Deploy Constitutional AI Service
3. [ ] Deploy Integrity Service
4. [ ] Verify service health

### Phase 3: Governance Services
1. [ ] Deploy Formal Verification Service
2. [ ] Deploy Governance Synthesis Service
3. [ ] Deploy Policy Governance Service
4. [ ] Deploy Evolutionary Computation Service

### Phase 4: Validation
1. [ ] Run end-to-end tests
2. [ ] Verify constitutional compliance
3. [ ] Check performance metrics
4. [ ] Validate documentation

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] All services responding to `/health`
- [ ] All services providing `/metrics`
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] Cache connectivity verified

### Performance Validation
- [ ] P99 latency ≤ 5ms (cached queries)
- [ ] Throughput ≥ 100 RPS
- [ ] Cache hit rate ≥ 85%
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] CPU usage within limits

### Constitutional Compliance
- [ ] All API responses include hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- [ ] All logs include constitutional compliance
- [ ] All configurations validated
- [ ] Compliance monitoring active

### Documentation Verification
- [ ] API documentation accessible
- [ ] Service documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment status reported
- [ ] Metrics dashboard functional

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Constitutional compliance failure
- Critical performance degradation
- Service health check failures
- Security vulnerability detection

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. [ ] Stop new deployments
2. [ ] Revert to previous version
3. [ ] Verify service health
4. [ ] Update documentation
5. [ ] Notify stakeholders

## Success Criteria

✅ **Deployment Successful When:**
