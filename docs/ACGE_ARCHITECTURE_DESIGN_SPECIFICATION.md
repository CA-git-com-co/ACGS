# ACGE Architecture Design Specification

## Executive Summary

The Adaptive Constitutional Governance Engine (ACGE) represents a strategic evolution from the current ACGS-PGP multi-model consensus architecture to a single highly-aligned model with distributed edge capabilities. This specification defines the technical architecture, integration patterns, and migration strategy for achieving >95% constitutional compliance with ≤2s response times while enabling cross-domain constitutional governance.

**Constitutional Hash**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`  
**Architecture Pattern**: ACGS-1 Lite with ACGE Integration  
**Target Performance**: ≤2s response time, >95% constitutional compliance, 1000 RPS throughput  
**Migration Strategy**: Zero-downtime blue-green deployment with automated rollback
