# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in ACGS

<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## 1. Overview

This document describes the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system used in the ACGS platform for managing user permissions and access to resources. RBAC ensures that users only have access to the resources and functionalities necessary for their roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

## 2. Constitutional Compliance

All RBAC operations and role definitions must comply with the constitutional principles of the ACGS platform, enforced by the constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`. Key principles include:

- **Least Privilege**: Users are granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
- **Operational Transparency**: All access decisions and permission grants are logged and auditable.
- **User Consent**: Where applicable, users must explicitly consent to permission grants or role assignments.
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations may require multiple roles to prevent a single point of failure or malicious activity.

## 3. Role Definitions

ACGS defines several roles, each with specific permissions and responsibilities:

### 3.1. Admin Role

- Full system access and administrative privileges.
- Constitutional compliance oversight and enforcement.
- User and role management capabilities.
- Access to audit logs and security configurations.

### 3.2. User Role

- Limited access to resources and functionalities based on assigned permissions.
- All actions are subject to constitutional compliance validation.
- Activities are recorded in the audit trail.

### 3.3. Other Roles (Examples)

- **Auditor Role**: Read-only access to audit logs and compliance reports.
- **Developer Role**: Access to code repositories and development tools, with restrictions on production environments.
- **Policy Editor Role**: Permissions to create, modify, and propose governance policies.

## 4. Implementation

The RBAC system is tightly integrated with the Authentication Service and the Constitutional AI Service. When a user authenticates, their roles and associated permissions are retrieved. Every action they attempt is then checked against these permissions and the system's constitutional principles.

## Performance Requirements

### Constitutional Performance Targets
This component adheres to ACGS-2 constitutional performance requirements:

- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
  - All operations must complete within 5ms at 99th percentile
  - Includes constitutional hash validation overhead
  - Monitored via Prometheus metrics with alerting

- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)
  - Sustained request handling capacity
  - Auto-scaling triggers at 80% capacity utilization
  - Load balancing across multiple instances

- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
  - Redis-based caching for performance optimization
  - Constitutional validation result caching
  - Intelligent cache warming and prefetching

### Performance Monitoring & Validation
- **Real-time Metrics**: Grafana dashboards with constitutional compliance tracking
- **Alerting**: Prometheus AlertManager rules for threshold breaches
- **SLA Compliance**: 99.9% uptime with <30s recovery time
- **Constitutional Validation**: Hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` in all performance metrics

### Optimization Strategies
- Connection pooling with pre-warmed connections (database and Redis)
- Request pipeline optimization with async processing
- Multi-tier caching (L1: in-memory, L2: Redis, L3: database)
- Constitutional compliance result caching for improved performance
