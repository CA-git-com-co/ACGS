# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in ACGS

<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## 1. Overview

This document describes the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system used in the ACGS platform for managing user permissions and access to resources. RBAC ensures that users only have access to the resources and functionalities necessary for their roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

## 2. Constitutional Compliance

All RBAC operations and role definitions must comply with the constitutional principles of the ACGS platform, enforced by the constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`. Key principles include:

- **Least Privilege**: Users are granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
- **Operational Transparency**: All access decisions and permission grants are logged and auditable.
- **User Consent**: Where applicable, users must explicitly consent to permission grants or role assignments.
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations may require multiple roles to prevent a single point of failure or malicious activity.

## 3. Role Definitions

ACGS defines several roles, each with specific permissions and responsibilities:

### 3.1. Admin Role

- Full system access and administrative privileges.
- Constitutional compliance oversight and enforcement.
- User and role management capabilities.
- Access to audit logs and security configurations.

### 3.2. User Role

- Limited access to resources and functionalities based on assigned permissions.
- All actions are subject to constitutional compliance validation.
- Activities are recorded in the audit trail.

### 3.3. Other Roles (Examples)

- **Auditor Role**: Read-only access to audit logs and compliance reports.
- **Developer Role**: Access to code repositories and development tools, with restrictions on production environments.
- **Policy Editor Role**: Permissions to create, modify, and propose governance policies.

## 4. Implementation

The RBAC system is tightly integrated with the Authentication Service and the Constitutional AI Service. When a user authenticates, their roles and associated permissions are retrieved. Every action they attempt is then checked against these permissions and the system's constitutional principles.
