# 6. Performance Benchmark Plan (v8)

The QEC-SFT framework introduces significant computational overhead, which must be measured and managed.

## 6.1. Latency Budget Breakdown (Asynchronous Pipeline)

The critical real-time path (`/govern` endpoint) is now decoupled, but the asynchronous generation pipeline has its own latency targets.

| Pipeline Stage                        | Target p95 Latency | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Diverse Representation Generation  | < 2 minutes        | Highly dependent on LLM performance and number of representations. |
| 2. Semantic Stabilization (SEE)       | < 5 minutes        | The main bottleneck. Formal model checking can be very slow.       |
| 3. Syndrome Diagnosis (SDE)           | < 5 seconds        | Should be fast (lookup or model inference).                        |
| 4. Certified Compilation & Signing    | < 10 seconds       |                                                                    |
| **Total End-to-End Pipeline Latency** | **< 10 minutes**   | Time from LSU creation to certified artifact availability.         |

## 6.2. Test Harness Specifications

- **Tooling**: `k6`, Prometheus, custom scripts for orchestrating the end-to-end flow.
- **Load Profiles**:
  1.  **Pipeline Throughput**: How many LSUs can be processed (generated, stabilized, diagnosed) per hour?
  2.  **SEE Scalability**: Measure SEE job completion time as the number of stabilizers and worker pods increases.
  3.  **SDE Accuracy**: Under a simulated fault injection load, what is the accuracy and performance of the diagnostic engine?

## 6.3. Scaling Strategies

- **SEE Parallelization**: The SEE is the primary scaling challenge. It must be designed as a distributed job processing system (e.g., using Celery, Argo Workflows) that can run multiple stabilizer checks in parallel across a large cluster.
- **Caching**: Aggressively cache the results of expensive stabilizer checks. If only one representation (e.g., Python code) changes, only the stabilizers that use it as input need to be re-run.
