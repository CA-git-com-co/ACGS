# 7. Security & Compliance Checklist (v8)

The QEC-SFT model provides a powerful new layer of security assurance.

## 7.1. Semantic Integrity as a Security Control

*   [x] **Correlated Fault Tolerance**: The QEC-SFT architecture is explicitly designed to mitigate the risk of correlated failures, where a single flaw in a specification or generator leads to multiple components failing in the same way. This is a primary defense against systemic, non-obvious vulnerabilities.
*   [x] **Verifiable Reliability**: The **Certificate of Semantic Integrity** provides a non-repudiable, auditable artifact that proves a component passed a rigorous, multi-faceted verification process before deployment. This moves beyond "we tested it" to "we can prove its internal coherence."
*   [x] **Defense against Malicious Generation**: If a component of the Generation Engine were compromised to inject subtle malicious logic, this logic would likely create inconsistencies with other representations (e.g., the formal spec or test suite), leading to a non-coherent syndrome and preventing deployment.

## 7.2. Cryptographic Key Management

*(Remains critical as in v7. All certified artifacts must be signed with keys stored in a hardware-backed KMS.)*

## 7.3. Data Governance & Compliance

*   [x] **Auditable Governance Trail**: The signed certificate, which includes the syndrome vector, provides an unprecedented level of detail for auditors, showing not just *that* a policy was deployed, but *how* its correctness was verified.
