# 9. Roadmap & Migration Notes (v8)

This document outlines the research and development path to realize the QEC-SFT vision.

## 9.1. Phased Research & Development Roadmap

The transition from the v7 pipeline to the v8 QEC-SFT framework is a significant undertaking that requires a structured R&D program.

*   **Phase 1: Theoretical Formalization**
    *   **Objective**: Develop a rigorous mathematical model of the QEC-SFT framework.
    *   **Tasks**: Formally define LSUs, representations, and stabilizers. Reason about the properties of the Semantic Syndrome space.

*   **Phase 2: Proof-of-Concept Prototype**
    *   **Objective**: Build a small-scale prototype for a single, critical sub-problem.
    *   **Tasks**: Implement the GenEngine, SEE, and SDE for 3-4 representation types. Develop a corresponding suite of Semantic Stabilizers.

*   **Phase 3: Fault Injection & Efficacy Testing**
    *   **Objective**: Systematically measure the prototype's ability to detect and diagnose semantic errors.
    *   **Tasks**: Build a fault injection harness. Compare the SDE's diagnostic accuracy against a traditional N-Version Programming implementation on the same set of faults.

*   **Phase 4: Scalability & Performance Analysis**
    *   **Objective**: Analyze and optimize the computational overhead of the framework.
    *   **Tasks**: Profile the SEE and GenEngine. Explore parallelization and caching strategies. Develop cost models to predict performance at scale.

## 9.2. Migration from v7 to v8

A direct migration is not feasible. The v8 architecture will be developed in parallel.

*   **Initial Step**: The v7 pipeline will remain operational for existing governance tasks.
*   **Pilot Program**: The v8 QEC-SFT framework will first be applied to a new, high-risk area of automated generation.
*   **Gradual Transition**: As the v8 framework matures and proves its reliability and performance, governance tasks will be gradually migrated from the v7 pipeline. The `Certified Artifact Store` of v8 will become the new source of truth for deployed policies.

## 9.3. Risk Mitigation

*   **Complexity**: The primary risk is the complexity of designing a sufficient set of Semantic Stabilizers. This will be mitigated by starting with a small, well-understood problem domain and involving domain experts in the stabilizer design process.
*   **Performance**: The performance overhead is a known risk. This will be mitigated by designing the SEE for massive parallelism and caching from day one, and by clearly communicating the cost/benefit trade-off to stakeholders. The framework is intended for applications where correctness is paramount, justifying the additional cost.
