### Performance Review Checklist

#### Pre-Review Requirements
- [ ] **Baseline Metrics**: Current performance metrics documented
- [ ] **Target Justification**: New targets justified with data
- [ ] **Impact Analysis**: Impact on system and users assessed
- [ ] **Monitoring Plan**: Monitoring strategy for new targets defined

#### Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] **Performance Targets**: All performance documentation updated consistently
- [ ] **Monitoring Documentation**: Monitoring procedures updated
- [ ] **SLA Documentation**: Service level agreements updated
- [ ] **Capacity Planning**: Capacity planning documentation updated

#### Review Validation
- [ ] **Target Consistency**: Performance targets consistent across all docs
- [ ] **Achievability**: Targets are realistic and achievable
- [ ] **Monitoring Alignment**: Monitoring thresholds align with targets
- [ ] **Alert Configuration**: Alerting configured for new targets

## 🔍 Review Process Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Review Preparation

```bash
# Documentation impact assessment
./tools/validation/quick_validation.sh > pre_review_validation.log

# Identify affected documentation files
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -E "\.(md|yml|yaml)$"

# Check constitutional hash consistency
grep -r "cdd01ef066bc6cf2" docs/ > hash_consistency.log
```

### Step 2: Review Assignment

#### Automatic Assignment (GitHub CODEOWNERS)
```
# .github/CODEOWNERS
docs/configuration/     @platform-team @security-team
docs/api/              @api-team @service-owners
docs/operations/       @sre-team @operations-team
docs/deployment/       @devops-team @platform-team
infrastructure/        @devops-team @security-team
```

#### Manual Assignment Criteria
- **Complexity**: High complexity changes require senior reviewers
- **Risk Level**: High risk changes require multiple reviewers
- **Scope**: Cross-team changes require representatives from each team
- **Compliance**: Security/compliance changes require specialized reviewers

### Step 3: Review Execution

#### Technical Review (24 hours)
1. **Accuracy Validation**
   - Verify technical accuracy of documentation
   - Check implementation-documentation alignment
   - Validate configuration examples

2. **Completeness Check**
   - Ensure all required sections present
   - Verify examples are complete and working
   - Check cross-references and links

3. **Constitutional Compliance**
   - Verify constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` presence
   - Check security requirement compliance
   - Validate performance target alignment

#### Security Review (12 hours for security-related changes)
1. **Security Implications**
   - Assess security impact of changes
   - Verify security best practices followed
   - Check for sensitive information exposure

2. **Compliance Validation**
   - Ensure regulatory compliance maintained
   - Verify audit trail requirements met
   - Check data protection requirements

### Step 4: Review Approval

#### Approval Criteria
- [ ] **Technical Accuracy**: All technical details verified
- [ ] **Constitutional Compliance**: Constitutional hash validated
- [ ] **Completeness**: All required documentation present
- [ ] **Security Compliance**: Security requirements met
- [ ] **Performance Alignment**: Performance targets consistent

#### Approval Process
1. **Primary Reviewer**: Technical accuracy and completeness
2. **Security Reviewer**: Security and compliance validation
3. **Final Approver**: Business and strategic alignment
