# ACGS-PGP Emergency Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines emergency response procedures for the ACGS-PGP (Autonomous Constitutional Governance System - Policy Generation Platform) with specific focus on achieving <30 minute RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and maintaining constitutional compliance.

**Critical Information:**

- **Constitutional Hash**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- **RTO Target**: <30 minutes
- **RPO Target**: <5 minutes
- **Emergency Contact**: ACGS Platform Team
- **24/7 Hotline**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX

## Emergency Classification

### Severity Levels

#### CRITICAL (P0) - Immediate Response Required

- **Constitutional compliance violations** (hash mismatch, compliance <75%)
- **Complete system outage** (>50% services down)
- **Security breaches** (unauthorized access, data compromise)
- **DGM safety pattern failures** (sandbox escape, rollback failure)

#### HIGH (P1) - Response within 5 minutes

- **Service degradation** (response time >2s, availability <95%)
- **Partial system outage** (1-3 services down)
- **Authentication failures** (auth service down)
- **Emergency shutdown system not ready**

#### MODERATE (P2) - Response within 15 minutes

- **Performance degradation** (high resource usage, slow responses)
- **Monitoring system failures** (alerts not working)
- **Non-critical service issues** (single service degraded)

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Constitutional Compliance Violations

#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify constitutional hash integrity
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/v1/constitutional/validate | jq '.constitutional_hash'
# Expected: "cdd01ef066bc6cf2"

# 2. Check compliance rate across all services
for port in 8000 8001 8002 8003 8004 8005 8006; do
  echo "Port $port: $(curl -s http://localhost:$port/health | jq -r '.constitutional_hash // "ERROR"')"
done

# 3. Activate DGM safety patterns
./scripts/emergency_dgm_activation.sh

# 4. Notify constitutional compliance team
./scripts/notify_constitutional_team.sh "CRITICAL: Constitutional compliance violation detected"
```

#### Recovery Actions (5-15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Isolate affected services
./scripts/isolate_non_compliant_services.sh

# 2. Restore from last known good constitutional state
./scripts/restore_constitutional_state.sh --hash cdd01ef066bc6cf2

# 3. Validate restoration
./scripts/validate_constitutional_compliance.sh
```

### 2. System-Wide Emergency Shutdown

#### Immediate Actions (0-2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Initiate emergency shutdown sequence
./scripts/emergency_shutdown_test.sh --execute

# 2. Activate human review protocols
echo "EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN_INITIATED: $(date)" >> /home/ubuntu/ACGS/logs/emergency.log

# 3. Notify all stakeholders
./scripts/emergency_notification.sh "CRITICAL: Emergency shutdown initiated"
```

#### Graceful Shutdown Sequence (2-10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Stop accepting new requests (circuit breaker activation)
./scripts/activate_circuit_breakers.sh

# 2. Complete in-flight requests (max 2 minutes)
./scripts/drain_connections.sh --timeout 120

# 3. Graceful service shutdown
for service in auth_service ac_service integrity_service fv_service gs_service pgc_service ec_service; do
  ./scripts/graceful_shutdown.sh $service
done

# 4. Verify all services stopped
./scripts/verify_shutdown_complete.sh
```

#### Recovery Procedures (10-25 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Validate system integrity
./scripts/system_integrity_check.sh

# 2. Restore services in dependency order
./scripts/start_all_services.sh --recovery-mode

# 3. Validate constitutional compliance
./scripts/validate_constitutional_compliance.sh

# 4. Run health checks
./scripts/comprehensive_health_check.sh

# 5. Resume normal operations
./scripts/resume_normal_operations.sh
```

### 3. DGM Safety Pattern Response

#### Sandbox Escape Detection

```bash
# 1. Immediate containment
./scripts/dgm_containment.sh --emergency

# 2. Isolate affected AI models
./scripts/isolate_ai_models.sh --all

# 3. Activate human review queue
./scripts/activate_human_review.sh --priority critical

# 4. Rollback to safe state
./scripts/dgm_rollback.sh --checkpoint last_safe_state
```

#### Human Review Escalation

```bash
# 1. Escalate to human oversight team
./scripts/escalate_human_review.sh --severity critical

# 2. Pause AI decision making
./scripts/pause_ai_decisions.sh

# 3. Manual review required for all actions
./scripts/enable_manual_review_mode.sh
```

### 4. Security Incident Response

#### Immediate Containment (0-5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Isolate affected systems
./scripts/security_isolation.sh

# 2. Preserve evidence
./scripts/preserve_security_evidence.sh

# 3. Activate security monitoring
./scripts/enhanced_security_monitoring.sh

# 4. Notify security team
./scripts/notify_security_team.sh "CRITICAL: Security incident detected"
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Critical Alert Triggers

```yaml
# Constitutional compliance violation
acgs_constitutional_compliance_rate < 0.75

# Service availability
up{job=~"acgs-.*"} == 0

# Response time degradation
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 2.0

# DGM safety pattern failure
acgs_dgm_sandbox_active == 0 OR acgs_dgm_rollback_ready == 0
```

### Automated Response Actions

```bash
# Auto-scaling on high load
kubectl scale deployment --replicas=5 auth-service

# Circuit breaker activation
./scripts/activate_circuit_breakers.sh --threshold 50

# Automatic failover
./scripts/failover_to_backup.sh --service $FAILED_SERVICE
```
