# ACGS Enterprise Architecture Migration Plan

This document outlines the migration plan for evolving the ACGS-PGP from its current 7-service architecture to the 8-service enterprise architecture specified in the GEMINI.md document.

## Phase 1: Architecture Analysis & Validation (Completed)

- [x] **Current State Assessment:** Completed.
- [x] **Technology Stack Gap Analysis:** Completed.

## Phase 2: Implementation Planning

### 1. Performance Target Reconciliation

- **Objective:** Create a realistic migration path with intermediate milestones to achieve the proposed performance targets.
- **Plan:**
  - **Tier 1 (Critical):** Establish a baseline performance benchmark of the existing 7-service architecture.
  - **Tier 2 (High):** Implement advanced caching mechanisms using DragonflyDB.
  - **Tier 3 (Moderate):** Optimize database queries and data models.
  - **Tier 4 (Low):** Introduce asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks.

### 2. Constitutional Compliance Integration

- **Objective:** Validate the feasibility of integrating democratic governance platforms and ensure constitutional hash compatibility.
- <!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->
- **Plan:**
  - **Tier 1 (Critical):** Centralize constitutional hash validation in a shared library.
  - **Tier 2 (High):** Develop a prototype integration with Pol.is or Decidim.
  - **Tier 3 (Moderate):** Implement the emergency shutdown capability with an RTO of <30 minutes.
  - **Tier 4 (Low):** Preserve existing OPA integration on port 8181.

## Phase 3: Phased Implementation Strategy

### 1. 16-Week Migration Execution

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 5-8): Infrastructure Foundation**
  - **Tier 1 (Critical):** Deploy Linkerd service mesh with zero-downtime.
  - **Tier 2 (High):** Migrate from Redis to DragonflyDB.
  - **Tier 3 (Moderate):** Set up Apache Pulsar for event-driven communication.
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 9-12): Service Expansion**
  - **Tier 1 (Critical):** Create the new `Model Orchestrator` service (8070-8079).
  - **Tier 2 (High):** Update existing services to support port ranges.
  - **Tier 3 (Moderate):** Implement blue-green deployment for all services.
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 13-16): AI Model Integration**
  - **Tier 1 (Critical):** Integrate OpenAI o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash.
  - **Tier 2 (High):** Implement the dynamic model router in the `Model Orchestrator` service.
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 17-20): Security Hardening & Enterprise Readiness**
  - **Tier 1 (Critical):** Implement Post-Quantum Cryptography (ML-KEM/DSA).
  - **Tier 2 (High):** Integrate with a Zero-Trust framework.
  - **Tier 3 (Moderate):** Conduct a comprehensive security audit.

### 2. Quality Assurance & Validation

- **Objective:** Maintain high quality and validate all requirements throughout the migration.
- **Plan:**
  - **Tier 1 (Critical):** Maintain >95% test coverage.
  - **Tier 2 (High):** Implement comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana.
  - **Tier 3 (Moderate):** Validate all constitutional AI constraints and DGM safety patterns.
