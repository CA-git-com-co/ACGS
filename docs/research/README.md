- **Constitutional AI**: AI systems designed to align with a set of explicit principles or a "constitution" to ensure harmlessness and helpfulness.
- **Reward Modeling**: The process of training a model to predict human preferences or desired behaviors, often used in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
- **Preference Optimization**: Techniques used to align AI models with human preferences, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), by directly optimizing a policy to satisfy preferences.
- **Causal Reasoning**: The ability of an AI to understand cause-and-effect relationships, allowing it to reason about why certain events occur and predict the outcomes of interventions.
- **Alignment & Safety**: Ensuring that AI systems operate in accordance with human values and intentions, and preventing unintended or harmful behaviors.
- **Machine Learning**: A field of AI that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
- **NLP & Language Models**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
