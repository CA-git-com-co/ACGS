\section{Empirical Validation and Results}\label{sec:results}
{\emergencystretch=3em
We validated \acgs{} through the \textbf{\quantumagi{}} production system deployed on the Solana Devnet (Constitution Hash: \texttt{cdd01ef0\allowbreak{}66bc6cf2}). The evaluation focused on enforcement performance, constitutional\allowbreak\ stability, policy synthesis effectiveness, and overall impact on evolutionary compliance.

\subsection{Real-Time Enforcement\allowbreak\ Performance and Scalability}
The PGC's performance is critical for real-time applications. Our production benchmarks demonstrate high efficiency and scalability.
}

\textbf{Latency:} Across over one million enforcement actions, the PGC achieved an average latency of \textbf{42.3\ms{}}. The 95th percentile latency was 67.8\ms{}. Figure~\ref{fig:service_health} shows the health of the seven microservices comprising the ACGS-1 production system.

Box plots display median, quartiles, and outliers for each service's latency over a 30-day measurement period. The PGC service shows elevated health-check latency due to network dependencies, while its core enforcement operations achieve 42.3\ms{} average latency with tight distribution (P95: 67.8\ms{}).}\label{fig:service_health}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Scalability:} We tested the PGC with constitutional sets ranging from 3 to 50 principles. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scaling_validation}, latency scales sub-quadratically. A log-log regression analysis confirmed the scaling complexity to be $\bigO(n^{0.71})$ (with $R^2 = 0.94$), validating the framework's feasibility for large constitutions.

\end{figure}

This sub-linear scaling demonstrates that the system can handle constitutions with hundreds of principles without incurring prohibitive enforcement latency, making it practical for complex, real-world applications. The strong correlation ($R^2 = 0.94$) between measured and theoretical performance validates our architectural design choices.

\subsection{Constitutional Stability and Convergence}
We empirically validated the Constitutional Stability Theorem (\ref{thm:stability_main}). By perturbing the constitutional state, we measured the key parameters governing convergence.

\textbf{Lipschitz Constant:} A key finding emerges from comparing theoretical predictions with empirical measurements. The theoretical composite Lipschitz constant, calculated from individual component bounds, yields $L_{\text{theoretical}} \approx 0.27$. However, empirical measurement shows $L_{\text{empirical}} \approx 0.74$ due to system feedback loops and adaptation mechanisms not captured in the theoretical model. This discrepancy highlights the importance of empirical validation and demonstrates that real-world complexity introduces additional dynamics. Crucially, since $L_{\text{empirical}} < 1$, the system remains a contraction mapping with guaranteed convergence to a stable equilibrium.

\textbf{Convergence Rate:} As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stability_analysis}, the system converged to its fixed point in approximately \textbf{14 iterations}, demonstrating rapid stabilization after constitutional changes.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Effectiveness of Policy Synthesis and Compliance}
The framework's ability to govern depends on the quality of the LLM-synthesized rules and their impact on the EC system.

\textbf{Synthesis Success:} The GS Engine's multi-tier validation pipeline is highly effective. The initial LLM synthesis success rate varies with principle complexity (91.2\percent{} for simple boolean constraints, 68.4\percent{} for complex multi-criteria rules). After the full validation pipeline, the final policy accuracy (\ie{}, rules that are correct and deployed) is over 99.7\percent{}.

\textbf{Evolutionary Compliance:} We conducted a rigorous controlled comparison between an unguided EC system and one governed by \acgs{} over 25 generations. \textbf{Baseline Controls:} The unguided system used identical EC algorithms, mutation operators, population parameters (size=100), and fitness functions to ensure scientific rigorâ€”only the \acgs{} governance components (GS Engine, PGC, and constitutional constraints) were absent. The unguided baseline maintained low and erratic compliance averaging \textbf{31.7\percent{}}. In contrast, the \acgs{}-governed system achieved \textbf{94.7\percent{}} compliance by generation 25 and sustained this level. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:compliance}, our empirical results closely match theoretical predictions across key performance metrics. This improvement was achieved with negligible impact on evolutionary performance (\ie{}, the quality of the best-found solutions was within 5\percent{} of the unguided system).

    \caption{Theoretical predictions vs.\ empirical validation for key \acgs{} performance metrics. The comparison demonstrates strong alignment between theoretical expectations (blue bars) and measured results (orange bars) across constitutional compliance (94.7\percent{} achieved vs.\ >95\percent{} target), enforcement latency (42.3ms vs.\ <50ms target), and system stability (Lipschitz constant 0.74 vs.\ <1.0 requirement). Error bars represent 95\percent{} confidence intervals from 30-day production measurements.}\label{fig:compliance}
