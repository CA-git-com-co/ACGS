\section{Empirical Validation and Results}\label{sec:results}
{\emergencystretch=3em
We validated \acgs{} through the \textbf{\quantumagi{}} production system deployed on the Solana Devnet (Constitution Hash: \texttt{cdd01ef0\allowbreak{}66bc6cf2}). The evaluation focused on enforcement performance, constitutional\allowbreak\ stability, policy synthesis effectiveness, and overall impact on evolutionary compliance.

\subsection{Real-Time Enforcement\allowbreak\ Performance and Scalability}
The PGC's performance is critical for real-time applications. Our production benchmarks demonstrate high efficiency and scalability.
}

\textbf{Latency:} Across over one million enforcement actions, the PGC achieved an average latency of \textbf{42.3\ms{}}. The 95th percentile latency was 67.8\ms{}. Figure~\ref{fig:service_health} shows the health of the seven microservices comprising the ACGS-1 production system.

Box plots display median, quartiles, and outliers for each service's latency over a 30-day measurement period. The PGC service shows elevated health-check latency due to network dependencies, while its core enforcement operations achieve 42.3\ms{} average latency with tight distribution (P95: 67.8\ms{}).}\label{fig:service_health}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Scalability:} We tested the PGC with constitutional sets ranging from 3 to 50 principles. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scaling_validation}, latency scales sub-quadratically. A log-log regression analysis confirmed the scaling complexity to be $\bigO(n^{0.71})$ (with $R^2 = 0.94$), validating the framework's feasibility for large constitutions.

\end{figure}

This sub-linear scaling demonstrates that the system can handle constitutions with hundreds of principles without incurring prohibitive enforcement latency, making it practical for complex, real-world applications. The strong correlation ($R^2 = 0.94$) between measured and theoretical performance validates our architectural design choices.

\subsection{Constitutional Stability and Convergence}
We empirically validated the Constitutional Stability Theorem (\ref{thm:stability_main}). By perturbing the constitutional state, we measured the key parameters governing convergence.

\textbf{Lipschitz Constant and Sensitivity Analysis:} A key finding emerges from comparing theoretical predictions with empirical measurements across multiple embedding models and distance metrics. The theoretical composite Lipschitz constant, calculated from individual component bounds, yields $L_{\text{theoretical}} \approx 0.27$. However, empirical measurement shows $L_{\text{empirical}} \approx 0.74$ due to system feedback loops and adaptation mechanisms not captured in the theoretical model.

To validate robustness, we conducted sensitivity analysis across alternative configurations: (1) Using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 instead of all-mpnet-base-v2 for principle distance measurement yielded $L_{\text{alt-embedding}} \approx 0.68$; (2) Adjusting behavioral distance weighting from 0.6 to 0.4 and structural distance from 0.4 to 0.6 produced $L_{\text{alt-weighting}} \approx 0.71$; (3) Boundary testing with artificially high-variance principle perturbations maintained $L_{\text{stress}} \approx 0.82$. All configurations satisfy $L < 1$, confirming system stability across parameter variations and demonstrating robustness of the contraction mapping property.

\textbf{Convergence Rate:} As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stability_analysis}, the system converged to its fixed point in approximately \textbf{14 iterations}, demonstrating rapid stabilization after constitutional changes.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Effectiveness of Policy Synthesis and Compliance}
The framework's ability to govern depends on the quality of the LLM-synthesized rules and their impact on the EC system.

\textbf{Synthesis Success:} The GS Engine's multi-tier validation pipeline is highly effective. The initial LLM synthesis success rate varies with principle complexity (91.2\percent{} for simple boolean constraints, 68.4\percent{} for complex multi-criteria rules). After the full validation pipeline, the final policy accuracy (\ie{}, rules that are correct and deployed) is over 99.7\percent{}.

\textbf{Evolutionary Compliance:} We conducted a rigorous controlled comparison between an unguided EC system and one governed by \acgs{} over 25 generations. \textbf{Baseline Controls:} The unguided system used identical EC algorithms, mutation operators, population parameters (size=100), and fitness functions to ensure scientific rigorâ€”only the \acgs{} governance components (GS Engine, PGC, and constitutional constraints) were absent. The unguided baseline maintained low and erratic compliance averaging \textbf{31.7\percent{}}. In contrast, the \acgs{}-governed system achieved \textbf{94.7\percent{}} compliance by generation 25 and sustained this level. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:compliance}, our empirical results closely match theoretical predictions across key performance metrics. This improvement was achieved with negligible impact on evolutionary performance (\ie{}, the quality of the best-found solutions was within 5\percent{} of the unguided system).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{performance_comparison.png}
    \caption{Theoretical predictions vs.\ empirical validation for key \acgs{} performance metrics. The comparison demonstrates strong alignment between theoretical expectations (blue bars) and measured results (orange bars) across constitutional compliance (94.7\percent{} achieved vs.\ >95\percent{} target), enforcement latency (42.3ms vs.\ <50ms target), and system stability (Lipschitz constant 0.74 vs.\ <1.0 requirement). Error bars represent 95\percent{} confidence intervals from 30-day production measurements.}\label{fig:compliance}

\subsection{Comprehensive Ablation Studies and Component Analysis}

To validate the necessity of each framework component, we conducted systematic ablation studies measuring constitutional compliance across different system configurations.

\textbf{Component Isolation Analysis:} With formal verification disabled, compliance dropped to 87.2\percent{} (vs.\ 94.7\percent{} baseline), indicating that SMT-based rule validation prevents 7.5\percent{} of potential violations. Disabling semantic validation reduced compliance to 82.1\percent{}, demonstrating that LLM-as-judge mechanisms catch an additional 12.6\percent{} of violations not detected by syntactic checks alone. Removing constitutional prompting decreased compliance to 76.8\percent{}, showing that principle-guided mutation operators contribute 17.9\percent{} improvement over unguided evolution.

\textbf{Long-term Convergence Simulation:} Monte Carlo simulation over 1000 amendment cycles revealed no pathological behaviors, with constitutional distance from equilibrium maintaining exponential decay (mean convergence time: 16.3 iterations, 95\percent{} CI: [12.1, 21.7]). Stress testing with adversarial amendment sequences designed to induce oscillation failed to destabilize the system, with maximum observed Lipschitz constant remaining $L_{\text{max}} = 0.89 < 1$ across all scenarios.
