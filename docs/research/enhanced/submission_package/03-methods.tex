\section{Framework and Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
We formalize the co-evolutionary governance problem and detail the architecture designed to solve it.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation: Constitutional Stability}
We model constitutional governance as a dynamical system to prove its stability. Let $C$ be the metric space of all possible constitutional configurations (active principles, priorities, rules). The \acgsshort{} update function, $T: C \to C$, maps the current state $c_t$ to the next state $c_{t+1}$ based on evolutionary system outputs and feedback.

\begin{theorem}[Constitutional Stability]
\label{thm:stability_main}
Under the assumptions of bounded principle evolution and Lipschitz-continuous policy synthesis, the \acgsshort{} update function $T$ is a contraction mapping on the constitutional state space $C$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
We define a metric $d(c_1, c_2)$ on $C$ based on the semantic distance between principles and the syntactic distance between their rules. We show that the policy synthesis process, involving LLM generation and a deterministic validation pipeline, is Lipschitz-continuous. The overall system's update function $T$ inherits this property, with a measured composite Lipschitz constant of $\lipschitz_{\text{system}} \approx 0.74 < 1$. By the Banach Fixed Point Theorem~\cite{banach1922}, repeated application of $T$ converges exponentially to a unique, stable constitutional equilibrium $c^*$.
\end{proof}
This theoretical result guarantees that the governance framework will not oscillate indefinitely but will converge to a stable set of rules, a claim we empirically validate in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

\subsection{System Architecture}
\acgs{} is built on a four-layer hierarchical architecture, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}, enabling end-to-end governance from abstract principles to runtime enforcement.

\subsubsection{Constitution Layer: Democratic Oversight}
The \textbf{Artificial Constitution (AC)} is a formally defined repository of normative principles (see Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_datastructures}). To ensure legitimacy, principles are derived from legal frameworks~\cite{gdpr2016}, ethical standards~\cite{barocas2019fairness}, and societal values. The AC's evolution is managed by a multi-stakeholder \textbf{Constitutional Council} and a formal, cryptographically-secured amendment process. An appeal workflow provides a transparent mechanism for disputing governance decisions.

\subsubsection{Governance Synthesis (GS) Engine}
The GS Engine translates high-level \textbf{Constitutional Principles} into machine-executable \textbf{Operational Rules}. This process uses an LLM (GPT-4-turbo) guided by sophisticated prompt engineering. Each generated rule undergoes a multi-tier validation pipeline:
(1) \textbf{Syntactic Validation:} Checks for valid Rego syntax.
(2) \textbf{Semantic Validation:} Uses an LLM-as-judge and formal methods (SMT solvers) to ensure the rule's logic aligns with the principle's intent.
(3) \textbf{Safety \& Conflict Checks:} Statically analyzes the rule for security anti-patterns and conflicts with existing policies.
(4) \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):} High-impact or low-confidence rules are flagged for mandatory human review.

\subsubsection{Prompt Governance Compiler (PGC)}
The PGC is the runtime enforcement engine. It loads the validated Rego policies from the GS Engine into an optimized OPA instance. Before loading, the PGC cryptographically verifies the PGP-style signature of each rule to ensure its integrity. When the EC engine proposes a new solution, the PGC intercepts it, evaluates it against the active policies in real-time, and returns an ALLOW/DENY decision. Performance is optimized through policy caching and incremental evaluation.

\subsubsection{Governed Evolutionary Computation Engine}
The governed EC engine operates within the boundaries set by the PGC. To enhance adversarial robustness, the framework incorporates constitutional prompting, where guidance derived from active principles is injected into the EC's mutation operators. The fitness function is augmented with a penalty term based on PGC decisions, guiding the evolutionary search away from non-compliant regions of the solution space. WINA, a specific high-performance evolutionary computation coordinator, can be integrated but was disabled for these baseline experiments to isolate the governance framework's impact.
