\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\acgs{} addresses the fundamental challenge of governing AI systems that continuously evolve their own behavior. By creating a co-evolutionary framework that integrates democratic constitutional principles with real-time, LLM-driven enforcement, we bridge the critical gap between static human governance and dynamic machine operations.

Our empirical results, validated through a production deployment on the Solana blockchain, provide strong evidence of the framework's efficacy. We demonstrated a significant increase in constitutional compliance from 31.7\percent{} to 94.7\percent{}, with a mean enforcement latency of 42.3\ms{}. The mathematical foundations of the system, including its guaranteed convergence to a stable state ($\lipschitz \approx 0.74 < 1$), were also empirically confirmed. These results establish \acgs{} as a viable, high-performance solution for intrinsic AI governance.

This work moves beyond conceptual proposals to offer a production-validated architecture for trustworthy AI\@. By making governance an adaptive, inherent property of the system itself, \acgs{} lays the groundwork for AI that is not only powerful and autonomous but also provably and dynamically aligned with human values and legal strictures. The open-source release of our framework provides a robust foundation for the community to build upon, paving the way for a future of constitutionally governed artificial intelligence.
