\section{Future Research Directions}
\label{sec:future_work}
This work opens numerous avenues for future research.

\paragraph{Near-term (1--2 years):} We will focus on enhancing LLM reliability for policy synthesis through improved prompt engineering and dynamic RAG. We will also expand real-world case studies to more complex domains (\eg{}, finance, healthcare) to refine domain-specific constitutional design patterns and further develop our formal verification integration.

\paragraph{Medium-term (2--5 years):} Research will explore self-improving constitutional frameworks, where the system autonomously proposes refinements to principles and policies based on performance data. We plan to develop game-theoretic models of constitutional stability to better understand and prevent sophisticated forms of ``constitutional gaming'' by advanced AI\@.

\paragraph{Long-term (>5 years):} Long-term goals include investigating cross-domain constitutional portability, allowing governance frameworks to be adapted and reused across different AI systems. Exploring decentralized, federated governance models for multi-organization AI ecosystems is another key direction.
