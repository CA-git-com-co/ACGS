# ACGE Research Plan
**Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2**


**Constitutional Hash:** `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`

This document outlines the research plan for the Autonomous Coding Governance Engine (ACGE) development and validation.

## Research Objectives

- Validate constitutional AI governance mechanisms
- Develop formal verification frameworks
- Establish performance benchmarks
- Create comprehensive testing strategies

## Constitutional Compliance

All research activities maintain constitutional compliance with hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` and support ACGS-2 production deployment requirements.

## Implementation Status

- âœ… **Constitutional Hash Validation**: Active enforcement of `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- ðŸ”„ **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of targets
- âœ… **Documentation Standards**: Compliant with ACGS-2 requirements
- ðŸ”„ **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ongoing link integrity maintenance

**Overall Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement implementation

## Performance Targets

This component maintains the following performance requirements:

- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
