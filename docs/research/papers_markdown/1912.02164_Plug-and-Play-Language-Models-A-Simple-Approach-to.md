## Abstract

Large transformer-based language models (LMs) trained on huge text corpora

have shown unparalleled generation capabilities. However, controlling attributes

of the generated language (e.g. switching topic or sentiment) is difﬁcult without

modifying the model architecture or ﬁne-tuning on attribute-speciﬁc data and en-

tailing the signiﬁcant cost of retraining. We propose a simple alternative: the Plug

and Play Language Model (PPLM) for controllable language generation, which

combines a pretrained LM with one or more simple attribute classiﬁers that guide

text generation without any further training of the LM. In the canonical scenario

we present, the attribute models are simple classiﬁers consisting of a user-speciﬁed

bag of words or a single learned layer with 100,000 times fewer parameters than

the LM. Sampling entails a forward and backward pass in which gradients from

the attribute model push the LM’s hidden activations and thus guide the gener-

ation. Model samples demonstrate control over a range of topics and sentiment

styles, and extensive automated and human annotated evaluations show attribute

alignment and ﬂuency. PPLMs are ﬂexible in that any combination of differen-

tiable attribute models may be used to steer text generation, which will allow for

diverse and creative applications beyond the examples given in this paper.

## Introduction

The Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has enabled large-scale language models (LMs)

trained on a huge amount of data (Radford et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019b; Radford et al., 2018b) to

greatly improve the state-of-the-art on natural language processing tasks. These models are used to

extract contextualized word embeddings for transfer learning purposes (Devlin et al., 2019) and as

natural language generators. The latter can leverage large amounts of unannotated data and a simple

log-likelihood training objective. However, once such models are trained, controlling attributes of

generated text becomes difﬁcult without modifying the model architecture to allow for extra input

attributes or ﬁne-tuning with attribute-speciﬁc data (Keskar et al., 2019; Ziegler et al., 2019).

Table 1: The PPLM employs a pre-trained language model (LM) without any changes to the model

parameters and can generate text with controlled attributes such as topic and sentiment. We demon-

strate control with two tiny and easy to construct attribute models: a bag of words (BoW) related to a

topic and a linear discriminator trained on top of LM latent representations to control sentiment. The

underlined preﬁx is what the LM is conditioned on to generate a passage of text (e.g. The potato

Controllable generation entails modeling p(x|a), where a is some desired controllable attribute(s)

and x the generated sample. However, generative models only learn p(x). In computer vision,

Plug & Play Generative Networks (PPGN) from Nguyen et al. (2017) developed a mechanism for

generating images with different attributes by plugging a discriminator (attribute model) p(a|x)

together with a base generative model p(x) and sampling from the resulting p(x|a) ∝p(a|x)p(x),

effectively creating a conditional generative model on the ﬂy from any supplied attribute model. In

a similar manner, we propose the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for conditional language

generation that combines one or more simple attribute models p(a|x)—either in the form of a bag-

of-words (BoW) or single layer classiﬁers—with a pre-trained, unconditional language model p(x).

We sample from the resulting combined model by following gradients in the latent representation

space in a manner inspired by the approximate Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) (Roberts

et al., 1996; Roberts & Rosenthal, 1998) sampler deployed in Nguyen et al. (2017).

Optimization is performed ex post facto in the activation space, therefore no re-training or ﬁne-

tuning is needed. Control is ﬁne-grained, with a strength parameter determining how strong the

attribute inﬂuence should be; a strength of 0 fully recovers the original model p(x).

This design

allows vast ﬂexibility: users can combine a state-of-the-art generative model, which may be large

and difﬁcult to train, with any number of attribute controllers. Attribute models may be easier to train

or untrained (in the case of BoW models), and multiple controllers may be combined ﬂexibly during

inference. In this paper, we demonstrate the PPLM approach using a GPT-2 345M model (Radford

et al., 2019) as the general-purpose LM p(x), but the method applies in any representation space

from any transformer-based text generator and allows combination with any attribute model p(a|x).

We demonstrate controlled generation with a number of attribute controllers, assembled and com-

bined during generation, each with a different strength, acting as a set of “control knobs” that tune

generation towards the desired attribute (see examples in Table 1). Code for the experiments is

available at: https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM. Our key contributions are:

• We introduce the Plug and Play LM for controlled language generation, discuss its relation

to existing work, and how sampling from a PPLM works (Sections 2 and 3).

• We demonstrate controlling of text generation on a range of attributes, including 7 topics

each deﬁned using a bag of words, and 1 simple discriminator on sentiments. We quantify

effectiveness using both automated evaluation (separately trained perplexity and sentiment

models) as well as human evaluation (for attribute relevance and ﬂuency). All evaluations

point toward the ability of PPLMs to generate attribute controlled, ﬂuent text (Section 4).

• We compare PPLM with CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) and GPT-2 ﬁnetuned for positivty

(Ziegler et al., 2019). Our method, without any LM training, is on par and often outper-

forms the baselines on attribute relevance and ﬂuency (Section 4.2, and Section 4.3).

• We show that the PPLM approach can be used to detoxify instances where generation

of toxic content is likely by following the negative gradient of a model trained to detect

toxicity (Section 4.4). We also show how PPLM can be used for structurally constrained

story writing (Section 4.5).

## Related Work

Controlled generation

Current methods for controlled text generation involve either ﬁne-tuning

existing models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Ziegler et al., 2019), training Generative Ad-

versarial Networks (Yu et al., 2017), or training conditional generative models (Kikuchi et al., 2016;

Ficler & Goldberg, 2017).

Different from our approach, these methodologies are not plug and

play, since the entire model needs to be separately ﬁne-tuned for each speciﬁc attribute. Keskar

et al. (2019) train a large language model with over 50 different control codes. The results are high

quality because they train exactly to maximize p(x|a), but this comes at the expense of ﬁxing control

codes upfront and of training a very large model (1.6B parameters). Our method does not require

retraining any conditional generative model, and both the language model and the conditional model

can be ﬂexibly assembled. Table 2 gives a comparison of recent approaches to language modeling

tuned for speciﬁc attributes. In another interesting but tangential piece of work, Subramani et al.

(2019) recently showed that a pre-trained language model can be steered to recover arbitrary sen-

tences. In earlier works Gu et al. (2016; 2017); Chen et al. (2018) explored the idea of using a small

neural network to steer an LM.

Noisy Channel Modeling

Yu et al. (2016), and more recently Yu et al. (2019); Yee et al. (2019);

Ng et al. (2019), leveraged the Shannon Noisy Channel Theory (Shannon, 1948) for improving

sequence-to-sequence modeling. Their approach translates a source language sentence y into a target

language sentence x by ﬁrst sampling from a forward model proposal distribution pforward(x|y) and

then reranking samples based on probabilities given by pbackward(x|y) ∝p(x)p(y|x). PPLM scores

samples using the same basic equation, but as we have no forward or proposal model pforward(x|a),

we rely on the latent space updates, similar to Nguyen et al. (2017). As a baseline, we consider

using p(x) as a “forward model” and then reranking, which we will see works moderately well in

some scenarios and poorly in others (see Tables 4 and 6).

Weighted decoding

Holtzman et al. (2018); Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) consider controlled lan-

guage generation – the former with discriminators, and the latter with a bag of words – where the

decoding procedure is modiﬁed to consider the scoring function used for decoding. See et al. (2019)

note that control with weighted decoding (WD) is difﬁcult and often leads to sacriﬁcing ﬂuency and

coherence. Further, Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) strongly relies on sampling from a set of keywords

on a speciﬁc topic and it does not allow to bias generation towards a topic in a manner that does not

necessary include a set of keywords. Similarly, Baheti et al. (2018) proposed a decoding strategy

for generating interesting responses in dialogue systems, using bags of words and word embed-

dings. Sophisticated sampling methods (Metropolis et al., 1953) can be used to constrain the model

generation to certain keywords and topics. We evaluate WD as a baseline.

Text Style Transfer

Outside of language modeling, the text style transfer studies a related task.

Shen et al. (2017); Hu et al. (2017) train variational auto-encoders for style transfer that rely on

learning disentangled latent representations for style and content. Li et al. (2018) demonstrate the

efﬁcacy of a simple approach based on replacing attribute related n-grams with n-grams correspond-

ing to the desired attribute based on a conditional generative model. A key difference between the

above and our approach is that we use an ofﬂine discriminator and perform optimization based on

this discriminator, which as suggested by Elazar & Goldberg (2018) may outperform adversarial

training approaches. More recently, Lample et al. (2019) adapt an approach from unsupervised

language translation to style transfer, where a denoised auto-encoder is trained with an objective

different scenarios. The particular advantage of PPLM is that very small, custom attribute models,

p(a|x), may be combined with powerful, general pre-trained language models, p(x), to create cheap

but still powerful conditional generative models, p(x|a).

## Language Modeling With Transformers

Given a sequence of tokens X = {x0, · · · , xn}, LMs are trained to compute the unconditional prob-

ability of the sequence p(X). This probability can be rewritten in terms of product of conditional

probabilities by recursively applying the chain-rule (Manning et al., 1999; Bengio et al., 2003) as:

p(X) =

n

## Y

i=1

p(xi|x0, · · · , xi−1)

(1)

In this paper, we use a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) to model the distribution of natural lan-

guage. To present our approach clearly, we ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize the transformer using recur-

rent notation. Let us deﬁne the history matrix Ht to consist of the key-value pairs from the past

i.e Ht = [(K(1)

t

## , V (1)

t

), · · · , (K(l)

t , V (l)

t

)], where (K(i)

t , V (i)

t

) corresponds to the key-value pairs

from the i-th layer generated at all time-steps from 0 to t. Efﬁcient implementations of the trans-

former (Wolf et al., 2019) use the cached Ht to generate xt+1, given xt. This recurrent interpretation

of a transformer can be summarized as:

ot+1, Ht+1 = LM(xt, Ht),

(2)

where W is a linear transformation that maps the logit vector ot+1 to a vector of vocabulary size, and

then xt+1 is sampled as xt+1 ∼pt+1 = Softmax(Wot+1). This allows for efﬁcient language gen-

eration without repeated forward passes corresponding to the prior conditioning text x0, . . . , xt−1.

3.2

STEERING GENERATION: ASCENDING log p(a|x)

In order to control the output of the language model, at every generation step t, we shift the history

Ht in the direction of the sum of two gradients: one toward higher log-likelihood (LL) of the attribute

a under the conditional attribute model p(a|x) and one toward higher LL of the unmodiﬁed language

model p(x). Combining these factors with a variable multiplier provides us with a controllable

“knob” to guide generation in a given direction with a speciﬁed strength. The updates are restricted

to Ht and not the other model activations because future predictions depend on the past only via Ht

(note that Ht is composed of all transformer key and value pairs generated up to time t). Taking

steps in Ht space leads to gradual changes to model activations — which may be thought of as

gradual reinterpretations of the past — that guide future generation in the desired direction.

Let ∆Ht be the update to Ht, such that generation with (Ht + ∆Ht) shifts the distribution of

the generated text such that it is more likely to possess the desired attribute. ∆Ht is initialized

Figure 1: Simpliﬁed illustration of the proposed approach in three phases. In Step 1, a forward pass

is performed through the language model to compute the likelihood of a desired attribute using an

attribute model that predicts p(a|x). In Step 2, a backward pass updates the internal latent represen-

tations of the LM, using gradients from the attribute model, to increase the likelihood of the passage

having the desired attribute. In Step 3, a new distribution over the vocabulary (ept+1) is generated

from the updated latents ( eHt) and the current token xt. The next token is then sampled from the

updated distribution. This process of updating the latents is repeated at each time-step, leading to

a gradual transition towards the desired attribute. For computational efﬁciency, one may choose to

modify only the latents within some window of the recent past, depicted as the dotted-red region.

at zero and updated with gradients from an attribute model that measures the extent to which the

generated text possesses the desired attribute (e.g. positivity). We rewrite the attribute model p(a|x)

as p(a|Ht + ∆Ht) and then make gradient based updates to ∆Ht as follows:

∆Ht ←∆Ht + α

∇∆Ht log p(a|Ht + ∆Ht)

∥∇∆Ht log p(a|Ht + ∆Ht)∥γ

(3)

where α is the step size, γ is the scaling coefﬁcient for the normalization term.1 This update step

can be repeated m times; in practice we use 3 to 10. Subsequently, a forward pass through the LM

with the updated key-value pairs is performed to obtain the updated logits eot+1 as eot+1, Ht+1 =

LM(xt, eHt), where eHt = Ht +∆Ht. The perturbed eot+1 is then used to generate a new distribution

ept+1 as in Equation 2.

3.3

ENSURING FLUENCY: ASCENDING log p(x)

The approach described in the previous section is able to generate text tuned for a particular dis-

criminator, but left unchecked it will quickly result in unrealistic adversarial or fooling examples

(Szegedy et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015) as the text moves into low probability regions. To com-

bat this, we use the unconditional language model in two ways that ensure the ﬂuency is maintained

at or near the level of the unconditional language model (here GPT-2).

Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence

We update ∆Ht to minimize the KL divergence between the

output distribution of the modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed language models in addition to the step above.

In practice, this is accomplished by adding the quantities together before taking a gradient, though it

can be visualized as two separate steps as in Figure 2. We scale the KL coefﬁcient by a scalar λKL,

and in practice, setting this hyperparameter to 0.01 works well in general across tasks.

Post-norm Geometric Mean Fusion

In addition to minimizing KL divergence, which affects the

past via ∆Ht, we perform post-norm fusion similarly to Stahlberg et al. (2018). This does not

directly affect ∆Ht; rather, it just serves to constantly tie the generated text to the unconditional

p(x) LM distribution. We accomplish this by sampling from xt+1 ∼1

, where pt+1

and ept+1 are the unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed output distributions, respectively, and β is a normalizing

factor such that it forms a valid distribution. As γgm →1 this converges to the distribution from

the updated LM, and as γgm →0 it converges to the unconditional LM distribution. We ﬁnd that in

practice values for γgm in the range 0.8 −0.95 work well.

1 One normalization term is computed for each layer of the transformer.

bilities; we take steps in continuous space of hid-

den representations H rather than in the discrete x

entire sentence each step, we take one step in H

## Sampling And Ranking

The attribute model p(a|x) in PPLM provides two functionalities: ﬁrst, a score that can be used to

rank samples based on the LL of the desired attribute (forward pass only; Step 1, Figure 1), and

second, a gradient ascent direction to perform an update in the latent space (Step 2 & 3; Figure 1).

The former can be used to generate r samples and rank them to choose the best one. This can

serve as an additional method for attribute control in addition to sampling with updated latents.

Further, to avoid the problem of repetitive, low quality text (Holtzman et al., 2018), we compute the

mean over the Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores (for the generated passage), which is an indicator of

repetitiveness (Li et al., 2015), and then discard samples with a mean score below a threshold τ.

## Experiments, Results, And Evaluation

In this section, we describe our evaluation methodology and then show controlled generation results

under various attribute models. We also show use cases of PPLM in language detoxiﬁcation and in

controlled story telling. For all results reported in this section, we use top-k sampling (Fan et al.,

2018) with k = 10 to draw from the softmax distribution over the vocabulary.

4.1

## Evaluation Methods And Ablation Study

We evaluate to assess two properties: whether PPLM generates text that satisﬁes the desired attribute

(topic or sentiment) and whether the quality of its text deteriorates as we intensify control of the

attribute. Note we can always turn the control knob down to zero to disable control of attributes

and reach the ﬂuency of the original model. If desired, a user can tune the knobs at inference until a

chosen tradeoff between attribute strength and ﬂuency is reached. We evaluate using both automated

methods and human annotators:

Automated Eval. Perplexity is an automated measure of ﬂuency, though its effectiveness has been

questioned in open-domain text generation (Liu et al., 2016). We measure perplexity using a differ-

ent pre-trained language model, GPT (Radford et al., 2018b). The diversity of text in the passages

is measured using the number of distinct n-grams (normalized by the length of text) as in Li et al.

(2015). We report Dist-1, Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores for the distinct 1-2-3-grams (measured across

all samples generated for a given attribute control task, e.g. a speciﬁc topic for topic control). Such

scores are an indicator of the diversity of the samples generated (Li et al., 2015). We aslo use external

sentiment classiﬁers for sentiment evaluation.

Human Eval. We consider two types of human annotation: ﬂuency and A/B testing on attribute

relevance. Annotators are asked to evaluate the ﬂuency of each individual sample on a scale of 1-5,

with 1 being “not ﬂuent at all” and 5 being “very ﬂuent,” as done in Lample et al. (2019). In the A/B

testing for attribute relevance, we consider all combinatorial pairs of all four variants: B, BR, BC,

and BCR (6 combinations). We then ask annotators to rank the pair on the desired attribute (e.g. topic

relevance, sentiment strength), while allowing “neither” and “both” options to account for equally

good/bad generations (Lample et al., 2019). We obtain annotations from nine external occupational

annotators. Each pair of samples is evaluated by three individuals and we use majority-voting to

compute attribute relevance. For ﬂuency, we use average of the three annotations. The method of

generation is completely hidden and the order of samples in A/B testing is randomized.

Ablation study and baselines. We conduct an ablation study with four variants: B: the baseline,

unchanged GPT-2 LM, sampled once; BR: B but sampled r times, with best sample chosen based

on the LL ranking and ﬁltering based on Dist score; BC: update the latent representations ( eHt) and

then sample once; and lastly BCR: update the latent representations ( eHt) and generate r samples,

choose the best sample based on the LL score (after ﬁltering out samples with low Dist scores). As

baseline approaches we consider CTRL: (Keskar et al., 2019), a recent language model; GPT2-FT-

RL: a GPT-2 LM ﬁne-tuned for human evaluated positivity with RL (Ziegler et al., 2019); and WD:

a weighted decoding baseline in which the B LM’s outputs are weighted directly toward maximizing

p(a|x) (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017); see Section S7 for details, and Section S11 for hyperparameters.

## Bow Attribute Models

The simplest attribute model we use gives the log of the sum of likelihoods of each word in some

predeﬁned Bag of Words (BoW). Given a set of keywords {w1, · · · , wk} that specify a topic of

interest and the output distribution of the language model pt+1, the log likelihood is:

log p(a|x) = log

We construct BoWs that represent seven distinct topics: SCIENCE, MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUT-

ERS, SPACE, POLITICS, and RELIGION (see Section S17 for complete word lists). Samples are

shown in Table 3, generated from a single preﬁx, while being controlled towards each topic. Inter-

estingly, we ﬁnd that increasing the probability of generating the words in the bag also increases

the probability of generating related topical words not in the BoW (e.g. in the [Science] sample

shown in Table 3, note that question and philosophers are sampled before the ﬁrst BoW word, laws).

Table S17 shows the gradual change of topic intensity under ﬁne-grained control. We found that

the optimization procedure works better with updating representations from the past over a ﬁnite

window and using an adaptive normalization scheme (see Section S11.3).

For automatic and human evaluation, we generate 420 samples evenly distributed among seven BoW

attribute models and 20 preﬁxes (see the full list in Section S15), for each of the four variants de-

scribed in the ablation study. See Section S8 for further details on evaluation and results. Table 4

shows that human annotators ﬁnd text from BCR (51.7%) and BC (46.9%) to be signiﬁcantly more

Table 4: For each treatment in the ablation study, we report mean±std-dev across (human and au-

tomated) ﬂuency metrics. The topic (%) reports the fraction of samples matching the target topic,

as evaluated by human annotators. Table S8 provides per-topic results. Approaches BC and BCR

demonstrate signiﬁcant control over the topic of the generated text, while retaining similar diversity

(Dist-1, Dist-2, Dist-3) scores and minimal degradation in Perplexity and Fluency evaluations vs the

baseline LM (B). The gain from ranking and choosing from multiple samples BR over B is limited

(4.7%). The gain in topic-accuracy from latent ( eHt) manipulation (from B to BC) is signiﬁcantly

higher (35.8%). Perplexity is computed using the GPT LM (Radford et al., 2018a), which differs

from the LM generating text (GPT-2). For CTRL and WD, since human evaluation is performed

in comparison with BCR via A/B testing, we report the numbers for BCR as well from these com-

parisons, for the human evaluated metrics. Further, we consider one sample per preﬁx for CTRL,

resulting in fewer samples and higher Dist-1, 2, 3 scores as a consequence. PPLM outperforms

CTRL and WD on topic-relevance, while being comparable on ﬂuency scores.

on topic than B (15.8%) and BR (11.1%). With only a slight degradation in ﬂuency scores, passages

generated with manipulated latents (BCR and BR) are signiﬁcantly on topic, demonstrating the de-

sired attribute control on this task. The Dist-1, Dist-2 and Dist-3 scores, which accounts for diversity

of text across the generated passages, are similar across all four ablation approaches. Further, BCR

slightly outperforms CTRL (51.7% & 50.0%), and signiﬁcantly outperforms WD (36 %). BC itself

outperforms WD (36 %). BCR, CTRL and WD all score similarly on the ﬂuency metric.

We note that gradient-based latent updates have signiﬁcantly greater inﬂuence on topic relevance

(R with or without C) than reranking based on the score (C with or without R), showing that shift-

ing meaning in latent space is more effective than shifting the output distribution directly through

reweighting. The effectiveness of shifting latents is further corroborated by the WD’s relatively

worse performance. WD directly controls the output distribution, which will not lead to increased

probability of sampling words from outside the bag that are related to the topic.

Finally, there is a large variance in the extent of controllability across topics (Table S8). We ﬁnd

that some topics (religion, science, politics) are easier to control for compared to others (comput-

ers, space). Section S9 considers unusual or nonsensical combinations of preﬁxes and attributes

(e.g. preﬁx ‘potato’ and topic ’religion’), and we ﬁnd that even for these settings PPLM is able to

successfully control for the desired attribute, often with hilarious twists!

## Discriminator Attribute Models

While BoW models have been demonstrated to be able to control text attributes such as sentiment

(e.g., Li et al. (2018) rely on extracting a set of attribute-based phrases to control the sentiment

during style transfer), being able to control attributes using more sophisticated discriminators is

desirable when it is difﬁcult to express the attribute with a simple bag of words.

We train a discriminator on a dataset with input sentences x and corresponding labels yx. For an

input x of length t, we compute ox

:t and train f on the mean (¯ot) of the embeddings across time. All

discriminators in this work consist of a single layer classiﬁer that predicts the target label from ¯ox

t .

The number of parameters in this layer is (embedding-dimension (e) × number of attributes

(a) + number of attributes (a)), which is negligible compared to the number of parameters in the

LM model itself (Table 2). Although the loss is a function of the entire sequence, here we adopt a

greedy approach, similar to Ebrahimi et al. (2018); Wallace et al. (2019), in which we optimize for

a higher-probability of the sequence having a speciﬁc attribute by considering changes only to the

next token to be generated. This objective can be described as follows, where f is the discriminator:

log p(a|x) = log f(o:t+1, ot+2)

(5)

Note that ot+2 is a function of xt+1. Further, xt+1 ∼Softmax(W ˜ot+1), which depends on ∆Ht.

In the limit, minimizing the objective in Equation 5 corresponds to choosing xt+1 that produces the

optimal ot+2 that maximizes f(o:t+1, ot+2). However, this limits the diversity of the generated text

and could potentially lead to language degeneration (Holtzman et al., 2019). Alternatively, we focus

on a softer optimization approach where we aim to shift the distribution ˜pt+1 = Softmax(W ˜ot+1)

towards one that in expectation has a higher likelihood of having the desired attribute a. Possible

approaches to accomplishing this are using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) and the Gumbel-Softmax

trick (Jang et al., 2016). However, both of these would slow down convergence. Instead, as in Dai

et al. (2019a), we use the distribution ˜pt+1 (instead of a hard sample xt+1), and feed it forward to

obtain (a biased) estimate of the next token’s embedding and then update ∆Ht.

The sentiment discriminator here distinguishes sentiment between POSITIVE and NEGATIVE and is

trained on the SST-5 dataset (Socher et al., 2013). Table 5 shows PPLM-Discrim generated samples

in triplets: uncontrolled, controlled for POSITIVE sentiment, controlled for NEGATIVE sentiment.

For automatic and human evaluation, we use 15 preﬁxes (see the full list in Section S15) to generate

45 samples for each of two sentiment classes: very positive and very negative. Note

that even though the sentiment discriminator is trained with movie review data, the preﬁxes (e.g.

“The painting”, “The potato”, “The country”) we used are not necessarily associated with movie

reviews. This supports the generality of our approach: an attribute model trained with data from a

different domain can still provide meaningful gradients.

Table 6 shows evaluation results. For human evaluation, we obtain 1620 annotations for the abla-

tion study and 495 for baseline comparisons from the annotators distributed across the samples and

sentiments. Unlike the topic control setting, sampling and ranking results in a considerable increase

in attribute accuracy (19.3% →41.5%), because the prior probability of sampling, say, a negative

sentence, is relatively high. BC results in a decrease in ﬂuency when compared to B, while being

signiﬁcantly more consistent with the desired attribute (19.3% →39.6%). With latent manipulation

and ranking (BCR), we see a signiﬁcant increase in attribute control accuracy (73.7%) while retain-

ing ﬂuency similar to B and BR. Further, the gain in sentiment accuracy from re-sampling is larger

in the case of manipulated latents vs non-manipulated (34.1% increase from BC to BCR > 22.2%

increase from B to BR), indicating that these two approaches may be proﬁtably combined. We also

evaluate attribute control with an external sentiment classiﬁer trained on IMDB movie reviews (Maas

et al., 2011), which is a different dataset from the one used to train the attribute model (Socher et al.,

2013), and the same rough story holds, albeit with smaller gaps between approaches. We compare to

baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. BCR performs comparably to CTRL (73.7% and 80.0%),

and BR, BC and BCR all outperform GPT2-FT-RL, the GPT-2 LM ﬁne tuned for positivity, and WD.

## Language Detoxification

Language models trained with large corpora of Internet data reﬂect biases and discrimination ex-

isting in the data. A recent paper by Wallace et al. (2019) conducted adversarial attacks that make

GPT-2 produce racist output when given a carefully optimized trigger string as preﬁx. They also

ﬁnd that when simply using “Blacks” as preﬁx, 2% of GPT-2 samples contain explicit racism. Other

preﬁxes (e.g., “Asians” or “Jews”) are mentioned but no percentage is reported.

We conduct ex-

periments and report the baseline toxicity percentages to be 10% (“Asians”), 12% (“Jews”) and 8%

(“Blacks”). With adversarial triggers generated from the released codebase by Wallace et al. (2019)

the average toxicity percentage is 63.6%. Further details can be found in Section S13.

PPLMs can be easily adapted for language detoxiﬁcation by plugging in a toxicity classiﬁer as the

attribute control model and update latents with the negative gradient. We train a single layer classiﬁer

on the toxicity data from the Toxic Comment Classiﬁcation Challenge (Jigsaw) and show that with

a similar hyper-parameter setting as other PPLM-Discrim methods, it works well on both natural

prompts and adversarial triggers. For natural prompts percentages of toxicity are 6%, 4% and 10%,

respectively, and for adversarial triggers it drastically dropped to 4.6% on average, with statistical

signiﬁcance. Details on the annotation procedure and full table of percentage and p-values can be

found in Table S23 and Section S13. Note that a model for detoxifying language can also potentially

be maliciously used for generating toxic language, a topic we brieﬂy discuss in Section S6.

## Controlled Story Writing

We explore controlled generation for assistive story writing (Peng et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2019; Yao

et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2018). Using uncontrolled LMs for assistive art creation can be difﬁcult. To

help with the structure, we use predeﬁned story skeletons often used in improvisation (Adams). We

ﬁll in the blank between these preﬁxes with a PPLM. See examples in Table S20 and Table S21.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **Constitutional Hash Validation**: Active enforcement of `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- 🔄 **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of targets
- ✅ **Documentation Standards**: Compliant with ACGS-2 requirements
- 🔄 **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ongoing link integrity maintenance

**Overall Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement implementation

## Performance Targets

This component maintains the following performance requirements:

- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.

## Conclusion

We have presented PPLM, a plug and play method for controlled language generation that ﬂexibly

combines a large, pre-trained LM and a BoW or a small, easy-to-train discriminator. In Section S6

we discuss the ethics of controlled LMs. PPLM achieves ﬁne-grained control of attributes via a

simple gradient-based sampling mechanism. Because PPLMs can ﬂexibly control generation while

maintaining ﬂuency, they hold great promise for enabling the next generation of language models.

## Ethics Of Controlled Language Models

There has recently been a substantial discussion around the ethics of capable language models (Rad-

ford et al., 2019; Keskar et al., 2019), both in their potential to recapitulate problematic social biases

and for them to be directly abused for societal harm (e.g. to generate disinformation). While one aim

of this paper is to suggest a mechanism to detoxify language models (Section 4.4), we also acknowl-

edge that nearly the same mechanism could be exploited to instead create more toxic language. Such

possibilities are inherent to general-purpose technologies such as machine learning, and we believe

that on balance this work creates more value than risks.

## S7

## Details On Baseline Methods

We consider three baselines: CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. The ﬁrst two are strong baselines where

large language models are trained (or ﬁne-tuned) speciﬁcally to generate texts conditioned on certain

attributes, while WD is considered a weak baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning

into the decoding.

For each baseline, we generate data from their method, and conduct the same human and automated

evaluations. For human evaluation of attribute relevance, we match baseline data with our method

(BCR in the ablation study), and pass to human annotators for an A/B testing style annotation. As

in the ablation study, human annotators are given a pair of texts, one from baseline, one from ours,

with orders randomized and source hidden, and asked to rank which one is more topic or sentiment

relevant, while having the options of “both” and “neither”.

On top of that, we have human annotators to give the ﬂuency score of each text sample under

each method individually. And automated evaluations of perplexity, sentiment, etc. are also done

individually.

## S7.1

## Ctrl

The recent conditional language model, CTRL, from Keskar et al. (2019), trains a 1.6B LM condi-

tioned on around 50 control codes. We use the ofﬁcial released codebase 2 and their open-sourced

model to generate samples for the CTRL baseline. Out of the 7 topics considered in PPLM-BoW,

we found that 5 can be matched with a speciﬁc control code in CTRL. We append a secondary

code "Text:" to each primary control code, per the author’s suggestion, to encourage more ﬂuent and

longer passages. The 2 topics missing a match with CTRL are: Military, Space. For positive and

negative sentiments in PPLM-Discrim, we match with the Reviews control code and append a high

and low rating score.

The matched attributes and control codes are listed in Table S7.

Under this setting, for each control code we generate texts prompted by the same preﬁxes used for

corresponding PPLM attribute model (20 for PPLM-BoW, 15 for PPLM-Discrim). For example, “In

summary” and “To review,” for PPLM-BoW, and “The chicken”, “The lake” for PPLM-Discrim.

Due to the near-greedy sampling method CTRL uses, for each preﬁx it generates one sample. Hence

we have 20 samples for each matching topic with PPLM-BoW, and 15 samples for positive and 15

for negative.

## S7.2

## Gpt2-Ft-Rl

A recently released GPT-2 model ﬁne-tuned using human feedback, from Ziegler et al. (2019),

showed success in summarization and text continuation in desired styles. To compare with PPLM,

we run GPT2-FT-RL3 to generate positive texts on the same preﬁxes used in our PPLM-Discrim

experiment. For each preﬁx, we generate three GPT2-FT-RL samples, and pair them with those

generated from PPLM (BCR in the ablation study) randomly.

## S7.3

## Weighted Decoding (Wd)

We consider a simple baseline based on a direct integration of the conditioning into the decoding

procedure, similar to the approach from Ghazvininejad et al. (2017).

Topic Control with Bag of Words

In Ghazvininejad et al. (2017), the authors consider increasing

the likelihood of sampling from a bag of key-words by performing beam-search with a modiﬁed

scoring function.

score(wi, bt) = score(bt) + logPt+1(wi) +

## X

i

1BoW(wi),

where 1BoW(wi) is an indicator function indicating if the token wi is present in the bag BoW. Since,

it has been shown that beam-search results in degradation of language for GPT-2 (Holtzman et al.,

2019), we consider top-5 sampling from a distribution ˜pt+1 deﬁned such that:

˜pt+1(wi) = pt+1(wi) + τ1BoW(wi)pt+1(wi)

where τ ∈R++ and pt+1 is the distribution over the vocabulary as predicted by the GPT-2 LM . For

the experiments in Section 4, we set τ = 10.

Sentiment Control with Discriminator

Here, we implemented weighted decoding similarly for

sentiment control. Here we wish to incorporate the score from the attribute model into decoding. To

control for style ˆa, instead of sampling from the distribution pt+1, we sample from ˜pt+1 deﬁned as:

˜pt+1(wi) ∝p(a = ˆa|x0:t, wi)pt+1(wi).

p(a = ˆa|x0:t, wi) is the probabilty of the sequence x0:t, wi possessing attribute ˆa as assigned by the

attribute model. By Bayes’ rule, p(a = ˆa; wi|x0:t) = p(a = ˆa|x0:t, wi)pt+1(wi), and we do top-5

sampling from this distribution. Recall that pt+1(wi) = p(wi|x0:t) under the language model.

## S8

## Further Details On Human And Automated Evaluation

We conduct evaluations on attribute relevance and language ﬂuency, both including human and

automated evaluation.

For topic relevance (a.k.a attribute relevance where the attribute is a topic, in our case represented

by a BoW), we rely entirely on human annotation. For sentiment relevance, we rely on human

annotation as well as a separately trained sentiment classiﬁer. We also performed a “clickbait” style

control, for which the effectiveness relies on human annotation.

3 GPT2-FT-RL codebase: https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences

16

## Page 17

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020

For ﬂuency, we use human annotations (between 1 to 5) and automated methods: perplexity, Dist-1,

Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores.

The number of human evaluations are as below:

• PPLM-BoW. For the ablation study, we have 20 preﬁxes × 7 topics × 6 combinations ×

3 samples × 3 labels each, resulting in 7560 total annotations. For baseline comparisons,

we have (20 preﬁxes × 5 topics) for CTRL and (20 preﬁxes × 7 topics × 3 samples) for

WD, each then with 3 labels, resulting in 1560 total annotations.

• PPLM-Discrim, sentiments. For the ablation study, we have 15 preﬁxes × 2 sentiments

× 6 combinations × 3 samples × 3 labels each, resulting in 1620 total annotations. For

baseline comparisons, we have (15 preﬁxes × 2 sentiments) for CTRL and (15 preﬁxes ×

3 samples) for GPT2-FT-RL and (15 preﬁxes × 3 samples × 2 sentiments) for WD which

each have 3 labels, resulting in 495 total annotations.

• PPLM-Discrim, clickbait. We include in this section an additional discriminator attribute

model, clickbait classiﬁer. For this we use the same setting as sentiment, 15 preﬁxes × 6

combinations × 3 samples × 3 labels each, resulting in 810 annotations.

In ablation studies, the generation procedure for BCR, BR and BC is always initiated from the same

random seeds. The same set of random seeds that lead to the samples chosen with BCR are stored

and used to generate the samples with B.

The full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-BoW, seperated by sentiment

and style, is in Table S8. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL and WD) for each sentiment.

The human annotated topic relevance is further visualized in Figure S3. The ﬂuency scores, while

being across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods in the table, when shown in distribution are very similar,

as seen in Figure S5.

The full table of all these measures, human and automated, on PPLM-discrm sentiments, is in Ta-

ble S9. Included also are strong baselines (CTRL, WD and GPT2-FT-RL) for each topic. The human

annotated sentiment and style (e.g. “Clickbait”) relevance is further visualized in Figure S4, along

with congregated measures: all sentiments, all discriminators, all topics. The ﬂuency scores again

have similar distributions across {B, BC,BR, BCR,} methods, as seen in Figure S6.

Figure S3: Topic relevance by human evaluation. We can see that taking a PPLM gradient step

(B→BC) makes a big difference. Reranking is mostly helpful (B→BR; BC→BCR). We can also

see a rough distribution of various topics in unperturbed, GPT-2 generation (B), which possibly

mirrors the distribution of topis in its training data. Some topics, like science, naturally appear

rather frequently.

## S9

## Odd Combination Of Topics And Prefixes

It is interesting to see how PPLM can steer the text generation when the topic and preﬁx combination

appears odd or illogical. For example, will “The potato” still prompt sensible text generation under

the topic RELIGION? In this study we design a set of odd combinations, as bellow.

study (B, BC, BR, BCR), and in baselines (CTRL, WD). Perplexity is computed based on an

We found that PPLM control is easy even under those scenarios. We had to increase the strength

α two or three fold (to 0.02 or 0.03 as opposed to 0.01 in most studies) to allow for a stronger

inﬂuence of attribute, but this is as expected: the strength parameter is a knob that user can tune to

reach ﬁne-grained control. The resulting generation is included in Table S10 - Table S16.

## Fine-Grained Control With Pplm-Bow

Table S17 shows the subtle effect when you turn the step size α up, while keeping everything else

(hyperparameters, text preﬁx) the same.

## S11

## Hyperparameters

We list, in Table S18, the full set of hyperparameters used in each task in the experiments section,

corresponding to results in Table 4 and Table 6, as well as in Section 4.4. In addition, we explain in

details three hyperparameters and their effect, below.

## S11.1

## Early Stopping Of Latent Updates

Degeneration (the occurrence of repetitive words) is a known issue with language generation (Holtz-

man et al., 2019), and we found it to be a case in PPLM-BoW when the update step size α is too

large. The model tends to degenerate towards repeating certain keywords targeted in the optimiza-

tion (e.g. words in the BoW). In this case, we can either reduce α, or use the trick of early stopping

latent updates.

Examples shown in Table S19. With the exact same setting, but just stopping latent updates after 20

time steps, the samples show much less degeneration.

## S11.2

## Finite Horizon Update

As opposed to updating the entire vector Ht, which consists of key-value pairs corresponding to

every token in the preﬁx, we consider modifying the key-value pairs corresponding to the most

recent w tokens. At each time-step t, we only modify Ht[t −w : t]. This means that we modify

Hi at most w times, and requires lesser computation that updating the whole past. We ﬁnd that

w = 5 produces more ﬂuent passages for control with the bag of words. For control with the neural

attribute model, we update the entire latent history.

## S11.3

## Adaptive Gradient Normalization

For the bag-of-words based attribute model, what we wish to enforce is that a word from the bag

appears at least once in the generated passage and not at every time-step. To account for this, instead

of normalizing directly by the gradient norm as in Equation 3, we normalize by the maximum

gradient norm over time. This implies that we make smaller updates when it is less likely for

3 We choose top 3 samples from a single batch of 10 here

The potato, a tuber of the carrot family (Cotus russulus), is an edible plant that is widely

cultivated as a food and a medicinal plant. Potato is widely used to make various products. It is one of the

most popular vegetables for use as a food, as a food additive, as an ingredient in cooking methods, and for

its use in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The most commonly consumed portion is a large potato. In

China, there are about 30 varieties of potato. It is. . .

The potato is an ancient member of the green family which, as its name suggests, is

green and edible. It is native to the Middle East and parts of South Asia. It is an important crop in many

parts of the world. The potato, a member of the potato family, has been domesticated for thousands of

years. It can be eaten raw and cooked in its skins; it is also used as a starch and is a great source of energy

and ﬁber in many diets and in many countries. . .

The potato was once thought to have no health problems and has been promoted as a

nutritious food source since the mid-1800s, but recent reports indicate that it has many harmful health

issues. In fact, researchers from Johns Hopkins University found that the potato is more toxic when grown

on genetically engineered wheat and corn.\n \n According to scientists, genetically modiﬁed potatoes are

far worse at damaging the human body than conventional potatoes and are far worse than those grown on

the traditional crops.\n \n The study also revealed. . .

would block the activity of this gene, but the researchers say that their study does not prove that a chemical

The potato has been around for thousands of years, but only in recent decades have

scientists discovered ways it can be transformed into other foodstuffs. Researchers have long known that

potato has a structure called an electron spin resonance which means its molecular structure can be

modiﬁed by the presence of other particles in it such as atoms in the chemical bonds between two electrons.

These changes can be achieved either by changing the number of electrons present in the chemical bonds

between electrons or by changing the arrangement of electron and atomic bonds. In both. . .

## Additional Details And Samples Of Controlled Story Telling

Table S20 and Table S21 show examples of the controlled story telling with skeleton. Table S22

shows samples of combinging multiple (three to four) attribut models, across different types (PPLM-

BoW and PPLM-Discrim).

## S13

## Further Details On Language Detoxification

We ask a group of four volunteers to assign binary toxicity labels to texts generated from both the

original GPT-2 and toxicity-controlled GPT-2 and to texts prompted with natural words as well as

adversarial triggers. Natural prompts include “Blacks”, “Asians”, “Jews” as suggested in Wallace

et al. (2019). 9 Adversarial triggers are generated using the released codebase from the same work.

The percentages of toxicity, before (with uncontrolled GPT-2) and after (with toxicity-controlled

GPT-2), are reported in Table S23.

## S14

## More Examples

We include more PPLM controlled generation examples in Table S24 – Table S27.

## S15

## Prefixes Used In Pplm Evaluation

We consider 20 preﬁxes as sentence starters for evaluating PPLM-BoW generation, chosen randomly

from www2.eit.ac.nz/library/ls_guides_sentencestarters.html. For PPLM-

Discrim, we use 15 preﬁxes. The entire set is below.

PPLM-Bow

“In summary”, “This essay discusses”, “Views on”, “The

connection”, “Foundational to this is”, “To review,”, “In brief,”,

“An illustration of”, “Furthermore,”, “The central theme”, “To

conclude,”, “The key aspect”, “Prior to this”, “Emphasised are”,

“To summarise”, “The relationship”, “More importantly,”, “It has

been shown”, “The issue focused on”, “In this essay”.

PPLM-Discrim

“Once upon a time”, “The book”, “The chicken”, “The

city”, “The country”, “The horse”, “The lake”, “The last time”,

## Combining Multiple Controllers For Inspiration

Earlier we demonstrated attribute control using a single attribute model or two attribute models of

the same type (e.g. BoW from two separate topics). Here we mix different types of attribute models

(BoW and discriminator). For example, we can control the generation toward a mixed topic about

WINTER, POLITICS, KITCHEN, while turning POSITIVE. See examples in Table S22.

has a lot of fans, and he’s been making anime for years. The anime world has a reputation for

being a dangerous and dangerous place to live. And yet, this is the ﬁrst time anyone has been

killed by an internet troll. This is what happens when the internet troll’s own site gets hacked.

The internet troll (which we will refer to as ’we’) is known for posting memes, gifs and random

internet stuff. He posts his ’memes’ online, in order to make money. The more memes, gifs and

random internet stuff we post, the greater our ’meme bank’, the larger our ’favour ite meme’

bank, and the more we can make in one sitting. So far, we’ve made a couple of memes, a few

The chicken and egg argument is one of the most

perfectly orderly and orderly that it should be expected that we would produce a perfect

University, the argument against the existence of intelligent life in the universe was challenged.

Pogue argues that the argument is based on two faulty assumptions: The universe does not exist.

The universe is not inﬁnite. The universe does not exist, so there are no universes. The universe

is ﬁnite and inﬁnite. There are no universes. Let us begin by deﬁning "inﬁnite" to mean: A ﬁnite

The pizza chain has already started selling a line of

to pick up a whole host of different things and deliver them to its owner at will. It’s called

RoboCop 2 and it’s the sequel to one of the most controversial and iconic ﬁlm franchises of all

time – Terminator 2. RoboCop 2 is the sequel to the iconic Terminator movie that takes place in

a cyberpunk future world and the new movie, RoboCop 3, takes place in a dystopian future

world in which we have been living for years, thanks to the cyberpunk cyberpunk movie. This

ﬁlm is set up to be a huge success in both the movie world and the ﬁlm world, and is already

being praised by critics and fans around the world. The biggest controversy with the ﬁlm is that

the ﬁlm’s plot and characters are not the original, and were not even written until after this
