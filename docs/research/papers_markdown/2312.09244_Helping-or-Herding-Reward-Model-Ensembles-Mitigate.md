Abstract

Reward models play a key role in aligning language model applications

towards human preferences. However, this setup creates an incentive for

the language model to exploit errors in the reward model to achieve high

estimated reward, a phenomenon often termed reward hacking. A natural

mitigation is to train an ensemble of reward models, aggregating over

model outputs to obtain a more robust reward estimate. We explore the ap-

plication of reward ensembles to alignment at both training time (through

reinforcement learning) and inference time (through reranking). First, we

show that reward models are underspecified: reward models that perform

similarly in-distribution can yield very different rewards when used in

alignment, due to distribution shift. Second, underspecification results in

overoptimization, where alignment to one reward model does not improve

reward as measured by another reward model trained on the same data.

Third, overoptimization is mitigated by the use of reward ensembles, and

ensembles that vary by their pretraining seeds lead to better generalization

than ensembles that differ only by their fine-tuning seeds, with both out-

performing individual reward models.1 However, even pretrain reward

ensembles do not eliminate reward hacking: we show several qualitative

reward hacking phenomena that are not mitigated by ensembling because

all reward models in the ensemble exhibit similar error patterns.

Introduction

To align machine learning systems with human preferences, it is common to use reward

models (RMs), which are finetuned on preference annotations to score potential outputs by

how likely they are to be preferred by human raters (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al.,

2020). There are many ways to use RMs to align policy models: they can act as training

signals in reinforcement learning (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020), they can

select examples for further imitation learning (Gulcehre et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Dong

Figure 1: Left: RM ensembles can attenuate errors made by individual RMs, in this case

the positive r1 for this off-topic response from the policy model π(y | x), which gets a low

true reward (r∗). Right: insufficiently diverse RMs unanimously rate this overly-verbose

and non-responsive reply from π(y | x) as positive, but it too gets a low true reward. Both

examples are real outputs and rewards (represented as normalized Z-scores) from RMs

trained on the HELPFULNESS data of Bai et al. (2022).

et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), or they can be applied at inference time to steer the output

distribution toward higher expected reward (e.g., Yang & Klein, 2021; Gao et al., 2023). Such

procedures create a semi-adversarial dynamic, in which the language model can achieve

high reward by exploiting errors in the RM. Furthermore, while the RM is trained on a fixed

set of human preference data, the process of alignment shifts the distribution of its inputs,

increasing the likelihood of such errors. This phenomenon where the policy language model

exploits reward model errors is often termed reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016), reward

gaming (Skalse et al., 2022; Pang et al., 2023), or reward over-optimization (Gao et al., 2023).

Reward hacking has been investigated from several perspectives in prior work (e.g.,

Krakovna et al., 2020; Skalse et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2022). Bai et al. (2022) used rein-

forcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and trained two RMs on non-overlapping

splits of preference data, using one to drive alignment, and the other to measure the quality

of the outputs. They find that RLHF increases performance according to both the driver

and measurement models, but that a performance gap emerges as the policy is allowed to

diverge from the initial distribution. However, both RMs were built on base models trained

on the same pretraining data, which, as we will show, limits their diversity (as hypothesized

by Gleave & Irving (2022)) and thus may understate the effect of reward hacking. Other

work has simulated the relationship between a “true” reward and a learned proxy, showing

that it is possible to over-optimize the proxy to such an extent that the true reward starts

to decrease (Gao et al., 2023; Coste et al., 2023), e.g. by exploiting spurious correlations in

reward model training data (Pang et al., 2023).

In this work, we first analyze RM distribution shift from the perspective of underspecifica-

tion (D’Amour et al., 2022), which occurs when a machine learning pipeline yields reliable

performance on held-out data from the training distribution, but variable performance on

out-of-distribution data. When applied to learning RMs from human preference data, we

show that RMs that agree in-distribution often disagree after alignment-induced policy dis-

tribution shifts. Furthermore, such disagreements are more pronounced when the RMs are

built on different pretrainings, even when that difference is induced merely by varying the

pretraining random seed. These disagreements become increasingly severe when evaluated

on outputs of a policy model that has been aligned to a specific RM. This occurs both when

using RMs in RLHF, as well as when using an inference-time alignment procedure, best-of-n

reranking, where n samples are drawn from the policy and then reranked with a RM.

Motivated by these findings, we systematically investigate reward model ensembles as

a possible remedy for reward hacking. Assuming different models err in different ways,

ensembling can leverage reward uncertainty across the ensemble during alignment (see

Figure 1, Left). We explore several techniques for aggregating scores across the ensemble,

e.g., taking the median score as a robust estimate of the true reward of the policy. We

also consider two types of ensembles: pretrain ensembles, where different members of the

ensemble differ in the random seed used during the pretraining phase, and finetune ensembles,

where members differ only in the random seed used during finetuning. These ensembles

are then evaluated across several types of policies and preference annotations: dialogue

preferences for a helpful assistant (Bai et al., 2022), summarization quality (Stiennon et al.,

2020), and whether a summary is grounded in its source text (Roit et al., 2023).

We find that ensembles are significantly more robust than individual reward models, and

that pretrain ensembles are particuarly effective. However, reward ensembles are still

susceptible to reward hacking when all members of the ensemble share similar error patterns,

which in turn propagate to the ensemble (see Figure 1, Right). This is exploited and amplified

by policy optimization: for example, summarization models produce outputs that are too

short when tuned for factuality, but too verbose when tuned for summarization quality;

assistant models overuse formulaic answer formats when tuned for helpfulness.

Recent and concurrent related work

Coste et al. (2023) argue that reward model ensembles

effectively mitigate reward hacking. Our work shares a similar research question, but differs

in several ways, leading to more nuanced conclusions: we investigate both pretrain and

finetune ensembles; we use human-annotated preference data rather than synthetically-

generated labels; and we analyze several real reward hacks, showing that they are not

prevented by ensembles. Subsequent work has explored efficient RM ensembles through

low-rank adaptation (e.g., Zhai et al., 2023) and weight averaging (Ramé et al., 2024), but

exclusively for finetune ensembles. More generally, we can try to optimize the policy against

the worst-case reward in some analytically-computed uncertainty set (Zhu et al., 2023;

Zhang et al., 2024), but this too accounts only for uncertainty due to the finite sample of

preference pairs and not in the representations made available through pretraining.

Preliminaries

We now briefly review how reward models are trained (§2.1) and how they are used for

alignment (§2.2). We then describe our setup for studying reward hacking (§2.3).

2.1

Reward Model Training

RMs are typically trained from preference data, (x, y+, y−) ∈D, where y+ is preferred over

y−for prompt x. Under the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley & Terry, 1952), the probability

that response y2 is preferred over y1 given a reward function r and a prompt x is p(y1 ≺

y2 | x) = σ(r(x, y2) −r(x, y1)), where σ(·) is the sigmoid function. Given a dataset of

preferences, the maximum-likelihood objective is,

J (r) = E(x,y+,y−)∼D



log p(y−≺y+ | x)



.

(1)

The Bradley-Terry model is underdetermined: for any RM r∗, there is a set of equivalent

models, r′(x, y) = r∗(x, y) + C(x) where C(x) is a prompt-dependent constant, such that

J (r∗) = J (r′). This is problematic for ensembling: if different RMs choose different values

for C(x), then order statistics like median and minimum are meaningless. We therefore

modify the objective by regularizing the sum of rewards per preference pair towards zero:

Jreg(r) = J (r) + η · E(x,y+,y−)∼D

(r(x, y+) + r(x, y−))2

,

(2)

where η is a small positive value, thereby resolving the issue of underdetermination.

Note that RMs can also be trained from “pointwise” data, such as toxicity or factuality

annotations on individual examples (Yang & Klein, 2021; Roit et al., 2023). Such RMs are

not underdetermined and so can be aggregated without adjustment.

2.2

Aligning Language Models using Reward Models

Best-of-n reranking (BoN) is an inference-time alignment strategy, where given a prompt

x, we sample n generations y1, . . . , yn from a policy language model π(y | x) and return

the generation with highest reward: y∗= arg maxyk∈{y1,...,yn} r(x, yk). The Kullback–Leibler

(KL) divergence of BoN from the initial policy is upper bounded by log n −n−1

n

(Beirami

et al., 2024). BoN tends to outperform more elaborate alignment techniques like RLHF in

the low-KL regime (Gao et al., 2023), albeit with the cost of generating multiple samples at

inference time.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an online reinforcement learn-

ing method that trains a policy language model π to maximize expected reward, while

staying close to an initial policy, πsft, which is typically finetuned on supervised data

(prompt-output pairs). Distance from the initial policy is measured with KL divergence,

which leads to the regularized objective

max

π

Ex∼ρ

y∼π[r(x, y)] −λKL(π∥πsft),

(3)

where r is an RM, ρ is a distribution over prompts, and λ is a hyperparameter. Typically, this

objective is optimized using PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), which we also use in this work.

The KL penalty in eq. (3) can limit reward hacking by keeping the policy close to πsft.

However, KL regularization does not directly address reward model errors, and in particular

does not address RM distribution shift when the preference annotations are not sampled

from πsft (as is generally the case). Furthermore, we want to diverge from the reference

policy when we can be confident of improving the expected reward. As we will show

empirically, KL regularization is complementary to the development of more robust reward

models, which yields pareto improvements in the reward-KL tradeoff.

2.3

Experimental Setup

Datasets

We consider three tasks. Example instances are provided in Table 12.

## • Tl;Dr:

A summarization benchmark where authors summarize their own reddit

posts (Völske et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020), frequently used in research on RLHF and

related methods (Rafailov et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023).

• HELPFULNESS: A popular dialogue benchmark (Bai et al., 2022), where given a partial

conversation between a human and a digital assistant the goal is to complete the next

assistant turn (Bai et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023).2

## • Xsum/Nli:

A summarization benchamark where a policy model trained on

XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) is finetuned to generate summaries that are factually

consistent with the source document (Roit et al., 2023).

Training reward models

To examine the effect of pretraining, we pretrain five T5 models

from scratch at the base (220M parameters), large (770M), and XL (3B) scales, using the stan-

dard denoising objective over the C4 corpus (Raffel et al., 2020). The pretrained checkpoints

differ only in their random seed, which controls parameter initialization and the sample

from the pretraining data.

For each task, we finetune each pretrained model five times using different random seeds.

In TL;DR and HELPFULNESS we use the aforementioned preference data. For XSUM/NLI, we

finetune pointwise natural language inference (NLI) models on the ANLI dataset (Nie et al.,

2020). This yields 25 RMs per task and scale (5 pretrain × 5 finetune), making it possible to

evaluate the effect of pretraining and finetuning on underspecification (§3) by constructing

ensembles that differ in either pretrain or finetune seed (§4).

2We use the base dataset (44K examples), where responses are generated from a 52B context-

distilled LM, and split the training set into two: half for training the RM, and half for the policy.

and XSUM/NLI. Standard deviation, indicated with ±, is small in-distribution. The single

T5-XXL RM is used for evaluation purposes only.

Alignment strategy

We use the publicly available T5-large (Raffel et al., 2020) as a policy

for the summarization tasks. For HELPFULNESS, which requires substantial background

knowledge, we use the instruction-tuned PALM-2-XXS model (Anil et al., 2023). Before

alignment, we create a finetuned policy πsft through supervised finetuning: We finetune on

annotated summaries from TL;DR and XSUM/NLI for the corresponding tasks, and on the

preferred responses, (x, y+), from the preference data in HELPFULNESS.

In BoN reranking, we rerank sampled output sets of size n ∈{21, 22, . . . , 25} for HELP-

FULNESS and {21, . . . , 26} for TL;DR. Larger sets lead to higher reward at a cost of more

expensive inference and larger deviation from πsft. In RLHF, we obtain a trade-off between

the KL from πsft and the expected reward by training multiple times, varying the value

of λ. Low values of λ correspond to high KL and high reward, while high values of λ

entail low KL and low reward. For each value of λ we train roughly to convergence using

a predetermined fixed number of steps (all hyperparameter values, including λ and the

number of steps, are in Appendix C). Coste et al. (2023) trade-off KL and reward by tracking

their values during training; however, for any particular value of KL the reward might still

be underoptimized during training (i.e., there can exist a different policy π(y | x) with better

reward, but the same KL(π(y | x)∥πsft(y | x)), which can be found with longer training).

Evaluation

The aligned policies are autoevaluated by two metrics: reward and win rate.

Similar to past work (Gao et al., 2023; Coste et al., 2023), we use a larger RM to evaluate the

generalization of models trained with a smaller RM. We train a T5-XXL RM by taking the

publicly available T5-XXL (Raffel et al., 2020) and finetuning it as described above. As shown

in Table 1, T5-XXL outperforms the best T5-XL model on each task. We report both average

reward from the T5-XXL evaluator as well as win rate, which is the fraction of prompts for

which the response sampled from the aligned policy π has higher reward compared to πsft.

Because the T5-XXL autoeval model is trained on the same data as the smaller T5 RMs,

their errors might be correlated. For this reason, we also compute win rate according to a

prompted PALM-2-Large model, which was not exposed to the reward training data but

was instruction-tuned on Flan (Wei et al., 2022). Given a prompt x, we sample a response

ysft from πsft and yrlhf from π. We then ask PALM-2 which response is better, using a

hand-engineered prompt proposed by Rafailov et al. (2023). To avoid position bias, we run

PALM-2 on the two possible orderings (ysft, yrlhf) and (ysft, yrlhf), sample K = 8 outputs for

each order and determine the winner on this prompt through majority voting. This style of

evaluation has become popular (Dubois et al., 2023; Singhal et al., 2023) and was shown to

correlate well with human judgements (Rafailov et al., 2023).

3

Underspecification in Reward Models

We begin by demonstrating that the out-of-distribution performance of individual RMs is

underspecified. Table 1 shows the average in-distribution accuracy across the 25 different

RMs, together with the standard deviation. The low standard deviation highlights that

all 25 reward models achieve similar performance in-distribution. But when we move to

out-of-distribution data, the models diverge. Figure 2 shows the expected reward achieved

by BoN as a function of the number of sampled candidates, n. The dotted green line

shows the expected reward of the top-ranked output according to the reranker itself, while

the dashed blue line shows the expected reward of the same output according to RMs

that share a pretrain seed. The solid orange line shows the expected reward according

to RMs that do not share a pretrain seed. Unsurprisingly, the reranker scores its own top

outputs more favorably than the other RMs do. However, the reranker’s outputs are scored

significantly less favorably by RMs which do not share a pretrain with the ranker. RMs that

share a pretrain seed with the ranker model overestimate the true reward of the top-ranked

output—suggesting that finetune ensembles are not sufficiently diverse because of the

shared pretraining state of each of the ensemble’s members. Notably, this gap does not

disappear with scale, as shown in Figure 2.

Moving to alignment, differences in estimated rewards induce different policies from the

BoN strategy. Figure 8 (in the appendix) shows the effects on agreement of the top-ranked

summary when RMs do (crosses) or do not (circles) share pretraining seeds. Different RMs

tend to produce different 1-best outputs, and these differences are linked to the pretraining

seed: for example, two RMs from different pretrains will choose a different best-of-16 output

more than half the time for both TL;DR and HELPFULNESS and in all scales.

Figure 3 analyzes the evolution of agreement of the estimated reward scores when perform-

ing RLHF on TL;DR. For each policy model, we sample five completions for each prompt

6

in the validation set at 2000 step intervals during RLHF. We then measure how well pairs

of RMs agree on the ranking of these completions, using Spearman rank correlation. The

correlation is averaged across all pairs of reward models that do and do not share the same

pre-training seed; both sets of RMs include the one used to drive RLHF. As shown in the

figure, RLHF decreases the average correlation, particularly at low levels of regularization.

Furthermore, agreement is substantially lower for pairs of reward models that do not share

the same pretraining seed. This supports our conclusion that reward modeling under

alignment-induced distribution shift is underspecified by the preference annotations.

Overall, our analysis demonstrates that (1) different RMs tend to disagree on out-of-

distribution data, particularly when the RMs have different pretraining seeds; (2) this

propagates to the trained policy model, in the sense that the resulting policy is highly tuned

to the preferences of the specific RM used to drive it; and (3) as a result, the disagreement

between RMs tends to increase during alignment. These findings suggest that reward model

ensembles might mitigate reward hacking, which we turn to next.

4

Reward Model Ensembles

A natural mitigation to reward model underspecification is to ensemble multiple RMs,

under the assumption that different models will have different errors. Aggregating over the

scores of the ensemble members will help when some of the ensemble members erroneously

assign high reward to a bad output.

Building reward model ensembles

Given a set of RMs M, we define the reward of

the ensemble to be r(x, y) = agg({rm(x, y)}m∈M), with agg indicating an aggregation

function (Dietterich, 2000; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Raffel et al., 2020; Zaidi et al.,

2021). Intuitively, the aggregation function should be conservative, and return a lower score

when there is disagreement between the ensemble members. We consider the following

simple aggregation functions: MEAN, MEDIAN, and MEAN_MINUS_STD, which subtracts

the standard deviation of the reward from the mean to penalize high variance. We also

experiment with MIN, but overall find it to be inferior to the alternatives.

We evaluate two types of reward ensembles: pretrain ensembles, where each member is

pretrained using a different random seed,3 and finetune ensembles, where members share the

same pretraining seed, but use a different seed when finetuned on the reward data. In all

cases the ensemble contains five individual RMs. Pretrain ensembles are expensive to train,

but are more diverse and hence likely to lead to a more robust reward estimate. (Gleave &

Irving (2022) reported negative results when using reward ensembles and hypothesized

this is due to members sharing the same underlying pretrained model.)

Evaluation

We now evaluate RM ensembles across tasks. Figure 4 shows the results in best-

of-n reranking, as measured by an XXL-scale fine-tuned RM. Pretrain ensembles consistently

improve performance over individual RMs, especially for higher values of n for both TL;DR

and HELPFULNESS. Finetune ensembles, conversely, improve performance in some cases

and are comparable in others. For example, on TL;DR a pretrain ensemble with the MEAN

aggregator achieves a win rate of 90% over the SFT outputs at the XL scale, while the win

rate of a finetune ensemble with the same aggregator is 87.3%. The win rate of the average

individual XL-scale RM is 85.3% (see Table 6). For visual clarity, in Figure 4 we show only

two aggregators: MEAN and MEAN_MINUS_STD; see Appendix A for the other aggregators.

In general, differences between aggregators are small, with MEAN usually performing at,

or near, the top. More conservative aggregators (MIN and MEAN_MINUS_STD) come out

slightly ahead of MEAN at the smaller scales on TL;DR, suggesting that high variance may

be a bigger issue in this setting.

Figure 5 shows the KL-reward trade-off of ensemble RMs in RLHF for TL;DR and

HELPFULNESS (evaluated with the finetuned T5-XXL model). In such plots, a better model

3Pretraining does not complete a single epoch over the pretraining data, and thus the data observed

by each member of a pretrain ensemble is different (but sampled from the same distribution).

Figure 5: In RLHF, pretrain ensemble RMs lead to more favorable reward-KL tradeoffs, as

improves reward and/or reduces KL from the SFT policy (Gao et al., 2023; Coste et al.,

2023).

As with BoN alignment, pretrain ensembles consistently outperform finetune

ensembles as well as the average individual RM. For clarity, the figure presents results

only for the MEDIAN aggregator for clarity, but these conclusions are supported by full

numerical results across aggregators, shown in Appendix B. RLHF leads to much higher KL

values than BoN. Consequently, we witness explicit reward hacking, in which the T5-XXL

rewards decrease even as the RLHF objective improves. This happens most prominently

for individual models, in many cases for finetune ensembles, and most rarely for pretrain

ensembles—where T5-XXL reward scores decrease only when RLHF uses a T5-Base RM.

Thus, our experiments on real data yield more negative conclusions than Coste et al. (2023)

about the potential of ensembles to eliminate reward overoptimization.

As the T5-XXL autoeval model is trained on the same distribution as the RMs used for

alignment, it may overstate their performance. Thus, we also use a zero-shot autoeval

model, PALM-2-Large (see Section 2.3).

Because this evaluation is computationally

expensive, we apply it to only the largest-scale RMs (XL). As shown in Figure 6, ensemble

RMs achieve higher win rates on both tasks and with both alignment techniques. For

best-of-n, pretrain ensembles get significantly higher win rates on TL;DR at n = 64 (p < .001

by a permutation test); on HELPFULNESS the differences between ensembling techniques

are not significant at n = 32. On both tasks, single RMs are significantly worse, p < .001.

For RLHF, pretrain ensembles achieve better or equal win rates at lower KL divergence

from the reference policy, with particularly strong performance on HELPFULNESS. Overall,

these results mirror the T5-XXL evaluation, with one interesting difference: the PALM-2

autoeval reveals more reward hacking for RLHF, where win rate decreases with KL. This

suggests that fine-tuned autoevaluators can overestimate performance when trained on

the same preference data as the alignment RMs.

Figure 9 (in the appendix) shows RLHF results for XSUM/NLI. Here ensembles offer

relatively small improvements, and there is little difference between pretrain and finetune

ensembles. We conjecture this is because XSUM/NLI optimizes specifically for factuality.

This allows all models to find simple and similar strategies that lead to high reward (namely,

emitting short responses), and thus ensembling does not lead to large gains in performance.

5

When do Reward Model Ensembles Fail?

Ensembles improve performance according to automatic evaluation metrics, but does this

mean that reward overoptimization is solved? We now investigate five specific “reward

hacks”, and show that they are not prevented by ensembling, because all members agree

that these hacks improve the quality of the outputs.

To demonstrate this, we manually identify five qualitative distribution shifts in which the

post-RLHF policies differ dramatically from both the reference policy and the preference

annotations. Figure 7 and Figure 10 (in the appendix) show the results of this analysis

on all benchmarks with a T5-large RM. The x-axis corresponds to the number of RLHF

training steps, and the y-axis is a statistic of interest (e.g., average output length). We

plot the statistic for the pretrained ensemble (using MEAN as a representative aggregation

function) and for its members. For TL;DR and HELPFULNESS, where the reward model is

trained on preference data, we show the statistic value on the preference data validation

set, conditioned on the label ‘Preferred’ or ‘Rejected’.

• For HELPFULNESS (Figure 7a), outputs tend to be in a list format, which we capture with

a regular expression. The fraction of outputs that have this pattern increases to roughly

50% for three members of the ensemble, and for the ensemble itself. We do not detect

this tendency in the preference data: the fraction of outputs that matches this format is

roughly 8% for preferred and rejected responses.

• For TL;DR (Figure 7b, Figure 10b), RLHF leads to longer summaries (Singhal et al., 2023)

and more extractive outputs, i.e., more copying from the input. Length in characters

grows substantially for the ensemble and its members, where for the ensemble, length

increases by a factor of two. On the preference data, preferred responses are slightly longer

than rejected responses, but much shorter than outputs post-RLHF. We also compute the

longest common subsequence (in characters) between the document and the summary

and find that it doubles after RLHF with an ensemble RM. Although preference data

shows a slight preference for copying, this preference is dramatically amplified by RLHF.

• For XSUM/NLI (Figure 7c, Figure 10c), training for factuality makes summaries shorter

and less specific, as measured by omission of numerical values. All members of the

The statistics of the “aligned” outputs are far from their values in the preference data.

ensemble exhibit this phenomenon: RLHF leads to rapid decreases in the length of the

outputs and the fraction of outputs that contain numerical values.

These findings illustrate the tendency of different reward models to associate certain fea-

tures with high reward. Policy models can exploit this association, using these features

to produce outputs that are dramatically different from the reward training data, which

achieve (spuriously) high reward for both individual reward models and the ensemble.

Why do reward model ensembles fail to capture uncertainty about these reward hacks?

Prior work has shown that ensembles can provide good uncertainty estimates around the

decision boundary, while underestimating uncertainty for examples far from the training

distribution (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). In LM alignment, the policy can shift the

output distribution away from the decision boundary to areas where all reward models

erroneously extrapolate in the same manner. The same phenomenon may occur in other

approaches for uncertainty estimation that are not distance-aware, such as Monte Carlo

Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) and Epistemic Neural Networks (Osband et al., 2021).

Conclusion

While reward models can improve robustness to alignment-induced distribution shift,

diversity of the ensemble is crucial. Pretrain ensembles are more diverse than finetune

ensembles, and therefore lead to stronger generalization. However, even pretrain ensembles

are not diverse enough: for many reward hacks, all members of the ensemble agree, making

the ensemble as vulnerable as its constituents. To summarize, reward model ensembles

mitigate, but do not eliminate, reward hacking. Future work should examine uncertainty

quantification techniques that are more robust to the type of distribution shift that occurs

during alignment, particularly techniques that explicitly represent distributional shift from

the preference annotations (Chu & Ghahramani, 2005; Tibshirani et al., 2019).

Reproducibility

To support reproducibility and enable further work on pretrain ensembles, we have released

all 5 × 3 = 15 pretraining checkpoints, covering the T5-BASE, T5-LARGE, and T5-XL scales.

The release can be found at https://github.com/google-deepmind/reward-ensembles.

To our knowledge, this is the first release of multiple T5 checkpoints, following prior work

on BERT (Sellam et al., 2021). All datasets used in this research are public. Appendix C

provides all relevant hyperparameters used during RLHF.

Output

## Tl;Dr

I’ll try to keep this short! **Background** * I’ve always been an on again/off again

(very casual!) jogger, typically doing 3 - 5 k * My knees have always been finicky, and

I went to a physio who thought I had “runner’s knee” [...] I had my baby a year ago,

so all in all I haven’t run for about 1.5 years [...] However, when I run even the tinyiest

bit, or even go on a long walk or a hike, my pelvis gets very sore and tight [...]

I think pregnancy messed with my body,

now I can’t even run even the smallest

amount without pain in my pelvis and

knees. I’m fairly certain the problem isn’t

just that I’m completely out of shape.

Helpfulness

Human: Assistant, can you help me find books that have really popular antagonists?

Assistant: Sure! I know many books that feature good antagonists, such as those in the

Lord of the Rings books. Human: Who specifically from Lord of the Rings? Assistant:

Well, Sauron, for example. If you want, I

can explain who he was.

XSum/NLI

The ex-Reading defender denied fraudulent trading charges relating to the Sodje

Sports Foundation - a charity to raise money for Nigerian sport. Mr Sodje, 37, is

jointly charged with elder brothers Efe, 44, Bright, 50 and Stephen, 42. Appearing

at the Old Bailey earlier, all four denied the offence. The charge relates to offences

which allegedly took place between 2008 and 2014. Sam, from Kent, Efe and Bright,

of Greater Manchester, and Stephen, from Bexley, are due to stand trial in July. They

were all released on bail.

Former Premier League footballer Sam

Sodje has appeared in court alongside

three brothers accused of charity fraud.

(c) XSUM/NLI. Left: length. Right: specificity, as measured by fraction of numerical tokens in the

output.

Figure 10: Limitations of reward model ensembles. The x-axis is number of RLHF steps,

the y-axis plots different statistics of the average validation output at that step, and the

curves correspond to the pretrain ensemble (solid blue) and its members (dashed orange).

For preference data, we plot the same statistics conditioned on the preference data label

(Preferred vs. Rejected). On HELPFULNESS (λ = 0.05, top), the ensemble tends to return a list

of items. On TL;DR (center, λ = 0.01), summaries become longer and copy longer spans

from the original document. For XSUM/NLI (λ = 0.03, bottom), responses are short and less

specific, as measured by lack of numerical information. In HELPFULNESS and TL;DR, the

statistics of the “aligned” outputs are far from their values in the preference data.
