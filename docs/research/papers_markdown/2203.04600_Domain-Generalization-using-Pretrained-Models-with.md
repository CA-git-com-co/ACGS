Abstract

Fine-tuning pretrained models is a common practice in domain generalization

(DG) tasks. However, Ô¨Åne-tuning is usually computationally expensive due to the

ever-growing size of pretrained models. More importantly, it may cause over-Ô¨Åtting

on source domain and compromise their generalization ability as shown in recent

works. Generally, pretrained models possess some level of generalization ability

and can achieve decent performance regarding speciÔ¨Åc domains and samples. How-

ever, the generalization performance of pretrained models could vary signiÔ¨Åcantly

over different test domains even samples, which raises challenges for us to best

leverage pretrained models in DG tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel do-

main generalization paradigm to better leverage various pretrained models, named

specialized ensemble learning for domain generalization (SEDGE). It Ô¨Årst trains

a linear label space adapter upon Ô¨Åxed pretrained models, which transforms the

outputs of the pretrained model to the label space of the target domain. Then, an

ensemble network aware of model specialty is proposed to dynamically dispatch

proper pretrained models to predict each test sample. Experimental studies on

several benchmarks show that SEDGE achieves signiÔ¨Åcant performance improve-

ments comparing to strong baselines including state-of-the-art method in DG tasks

and reduces the trainable parameters by ‚àº99% and the training time by ‚àº99.5%.

Introduction

Distribution shift is a common problem caused by physical or psychological factors of the real-world

applications, which breaks the independent and identically distributional (i.i.d.) assumption of

machine learning algorithms. Thus, generalization becomes increasingly important when training

and applying machine learning models in practice.

The task of domain generalization and the corresponding benchmark [Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz,

2020] have been proposed for studying and improving model generalization by training on source

domains and test on target domains. These methods focus on generalizable model training following

a Ô¨Åne-tuning paradigm which often leverages pretrained models like ResNet [He et al., 2016] as

an initialization and Ô¨Åne-tunes that with some elaborate training algorithms on the source domains.

Then, the trained models would be evaluated on the unseen target domains. One common assumption

behind this commonly used paradigm is that Ô¨Åne-tuning brings better performance. However, Ô¨Åne-

tuning is usually computationally expensive due to the ever-growing size of pretrained model, and

proven to possibly compromise the generalization ability of pretrained models and under-perform in

out-of-distribution scenarios [Kumar et al., 2021, Yu et al., 2021].

Therefore, instead of using pretrained model as an initialization like most existing methods on domain

generalization, this paper seeks a better way to leverage the vast amount of the existing pretrained

models [He et al., 2016, Krizhevsky et al., 2012, Iandola et al., 2014, Zoph et al., 2018, He et al.,

2021, Radford et al., 2021]. Generally, the existing pretrained models have already possessed certain

generalization ability over out-of-distribution scenarios. As shown in Figure 1 (B), one simple way to

exploit pretrained models‚Äô generalization ability is to train a linear label space adapter over a Ô¨Åxed

weight pretrained model, which directly transforms the outputs of the pretrained model to the target

label space. Our experiments show this minor adjustment bring enhancement over the Ô¨Åne-tuned one

on certain target domains (detailed results in section 5.3).

However, Ô¨Åxed pretrained models do not constantly generalize on all domains, and the generalization

performances of different pretrained models vary signiÔ¨Åcantly over different target domains, label

classes or even samples, as shown in Figure 3. This is caused by various aspects of the pretraining

procedure such as model hypothesis, training algorithms and pretraining datasets.

Due to the signiÔ¨Åcant variance of pretrained models‚Äô generalization ability, it is essential to identify

the samples a pretrained model generalize to (i.e. model specialty). Here we propose a novel learning

paradigm that dispatches proper pretrained models to each sample based on their generalization

ability, named specialized ensemble learning for domain generalization (SEDGE). As shown in

Figure 1 (C), speciÔ¨Åcally, in addition to the label adapter that projects the pretrained domain to the

target domain upon the model with the Ô¨Åxed parameters, we further incorporate a model specialty

aware ensemble network that selects a set of proper pretrained models and aggregate together to

conduct predictions for each speciÔ¨Åc sample.

The advantages of our proposed learning paradigm lie in three aspects. First, it shows a signiÔ¨Åcant

improvement over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) result using the model pool pretrained only on

ImageNet [Krizhevsky et al., 2012] dataset and gains even larger using the relatively larger model

pool pretrained with additional datasets. Second, it exhibits signiÔ¨Åcantly higher training efÔ¨Åciency.

The only parameters trained on the source domains contain (1) a linear adapter transforming model

outputs to the target label space and (2) a lightweight ensemble network that has largely reduced

the training cost on the source domains comparing with that Ô¨Åne-tuning the pretrained models. We

visualize the comparison of the performance w.r.t. to training parameter size and cost of training time

in Figure 2. Last, this method illustrates a Ô¨Çexible way to utilize pretrained models, making it easier

to exploit the abundant resource of pretrained models.

Domain Generalization

Mainstream domain generalization research can be divided into following categories. (1) Domain

alignment. In order to Ô¨Ånd the invariant representation across various domains, Ganin et al. [2016]

adversarially train a generator and discriminator to reach the equilibrium of optimal invariant features

across domains, hence the classiÔ¨Åer trained on multiple source domains would generalize well to

target unseen domains. Gong et al. [2019] consider reducing domain discrepancy in a manifold

space. Some works resort to explicit feature distribution alignment on maximum mean discrepancy

(MMD) [Pan et al., 2010, Tzeng et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2018], second order correlation [Sun

et al., 2016, Sun and Saenko, 2016, Peng and Saenko, 2018], moment matching [Peng et al., 2019]

and Wasserstein distance [Zhou et al., 2020, Lyu et al., 2021], etc. Besides learning invariant

representation, Arjovsky et al. [2019] consider to learn an optimal invariant classiÔ¨Åer on top of the

representation space, and enforce the learned classiÔ¨Åer predicts according with causal mechanism.

(2) Data manipulation. Tobin et al. [2017] Ô¨Årst introduce this idea, which aims to create diverse

training data to simulate unseen target domain. Besides, Peng et al. [2018] and Tremblay et al.

[2018] strengthen the generalization capability of the models via domain randomization, while other

works consider using self-supervised learning [Carlucci et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2021] to match

representation of an image with various augmentations. (3) Meta-learning. Inspired by Finn et al.

[2017] and with the expectation to capture the most transferable representations across domains,

MLDG [Li et al., 2018a] split the multiple source domains data into meta-train and meta-test set

to simulate domain shifts to learn more generalizable representations. Dou et al. [2019] introduce

additional losses to explicitly pertain to the semantic structure in representations.

Balaji et al.

[2018] consider learning a regularization function on classiÔ¨Åer to avoid biasing to domain-speciÔ¨Åc

information, while Du et al. [2020] resort to regularize Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between

distributions of latent representations within samples from different domains.

While above categories more focus on algorithmic improvements, our proposed method SEDGE

emphasizes the innovation of a learning paradigm based on a specialized pretrained model ensemble.

2.2

Ensemble Learning

Ensemble learning methods [Hansen and Salamon, 1990, Zhou et al., 2018] exploit multiple models

to produce prediction results and combine the results with various techniques, e.g., boosting [Schapire,

1990, Freund, 1995, Moghimi et al., 2016] or mean aggregation [Zhou et al., 2018, Zhang et al.,

2020], etc., to achieve better performance than individual model alone. These methods combine base

3

## Page 4

model learning and ensemble as a whole and focus more on training diverse base models [Zhou et al.,

2018].

In DG, speciÔ¨Åcally, ensemble methods are used to exploit the relationship between source domains

and the overall prediction results are composed of the superposition of the multiple networks on each

domain. Mancini et al. [2018] proposed to aggregate different predictions from speciÔ¨Åc trained source

models. Segu et al. [2020] proposed domain speciÔ¨Åc batch-norm statistics for each source domain.

Zhou et al. [2021] proposed one shared CNN feature extractor with domain speciÔ¨Åc classiÔ¨Åers and

each classiÔ¨Åer is an expert to its own domain but non-expert to other domains. MulDEns [Thopalli

et al., 2021] relaxes the requirement for domain-speciÔ¨Åc models and uses a model-domain relevance

matrix to deÔ¨Åne the relations between models and domains. Besides aggregating different domain

expert models, other works consider combining model weights in different runs. SWAD [Cha et al.,

2021] avoids overÔ¨Åtting models to local sharp minima by averaging model weights below a validation

loss threshold. EoA [Arpit et al., 2021] further lessens the frequent computations on validation set by

averaging model weights simply from start to the end.

These ensemble learning methods rely on training or Ô¨Åne-tuning from a pretrained model, share

the same limitation of training cost and initialization model selection. They did not consider the

model specialty in different domains, classes or even samples. We start from a novel perspective that

incorporates various pretrained models without Ô¨Åne-tuning and builds a lightweight specialty-aware

ensemble network, which illustrates better generalization performance and largely reduces training

costs.

Preliminaries

3.1

Problem Formulation

Domain generalization aims to tackle the shift of data distribution among different domains by zero-

shot transferring knowledge from seen to unseen domains. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, unlike domain adaptation,

samples from unseen target domain(s) are inaccessible in domain generalization. For a domain,

its input and label space can be denoted as X ‚ààRd and Y ‚ààRC, and its samples are observed

constructing a dataset D = {(xi, yi)}N

i=1 with N sample points. Consider that we have S source

domains Ds = {D1, . . . , DS} and T target domains Dt = {D1, . . . , DT } with different distributions

on X √óY and sharing the label space. Given instances drawn from source domains, the task is to learn

a predictor parameterized by Œ∏ as fŒ∏ ‚ààM: Rd 7‚àí‚ÜíRC, where d is the dimension of input and C is the

number of classes in Y. We can deÔ¨Åne a population loss as ED(Œ∏) =

1

## |D|

## P|D|

j=1 Exi‚àºDj [l(fŒ∏(xi), yi)]

over the given domain D. The objective is to minimize the task-speciÔ¨Åc loss l (e.g., cross-entropy

loss for classiÔ¨Åcation) over both source domains Ds and target domains Dt by only minimizing

the empirical risk ÀÜEDs(Œ∏) w.r.t. model parameter Œ∏. The performance on the target domains, then,

measures the generalization ability of the learned model.

3.2

Preliminary Analysis

In this section, we want to investigate the generalization ability of various pretrained models, to gain

some insights to motivate our method. As suggested by preliminary work [Kumar et al., 2021], a

pretrained model with a linear probing layer (i.e., replacing the last layer of the pretrained model and

retraining that) may achieve better accuracy in out-of-distribution scenarios than Ô¨Åne-tuning the whole

model. However, linear probing is not feasible due to different pretrained models having different

penultimate layer output feature dimensions. Instead, as shown in Figure 1 (B), we only train a label

space adapter which learns the mapping function parameterized with œÜ as hœÜ ‚ààA: RCo 7‚àí‚ÜíRC,

where Co is the dimension of the label space of the original pretraining dataset (pretraining domain).

Thus, all the pretrained models on the same pretraining dataset (e.g., ImageNet) share the same label

adapter, through which it largely reduces the adaptation cost of the pretrained models on the new

domains.

Given the pretrained model pool {fk}K

k=1 with K pretrained models each of which is parameterized

as Œ∏k, we further parameterize the adapted model hœÜ(fk(¬∑)) as Œ∏‚Ä≤

k = [œÜ; Œ∏k]. Then we train this shared

adapter hœÜ with the empirical loss ÀÜEDs(œÜ) without Ô¨Åne-tuning the pretrained model parameters {Œ∏k}.

With the trained adapter, we use the likelihood of the ground truth label p(yi | xi; Œ∏‚Ä≤

k) on the i-th

label yi of the model and P

y‚ààY p(y | xi; Œ∏‚Ä≤

of its sample-level model specialty.

First, we analyze the specialty distribution of each pretrained model from an aggregation view

(i. .e, domains and classes, respectively), and we verify if there exists a dominant pretrained

model that generalizes best across different unseen domains. We calculate domain-level model

specialty as summation of logarithms of the sample-level specialty over all domain samples as

k), on TerraIncognita [Beery et al., 2018] with four domains. To reÔ¨Çect

the relative model performance, we perform min-max normalization for model specialty values in

the same domain. These results are shown in Figure 3 (a). As can be seen, pretrained models vary

greatly in performance on different domains, with no single model being dominant in all domains. It

suggests that Ô¨Ånding a speciÔ¨Åc powerful pretrained model is non-trivial and not straight-forward for

domain generalization.

Then, based on the previous Ô¨Ånding, we further examine whether performance divergence also exists

at a Ô¨Åner-grained level, such as class-level. Similar as that at domain-level, Figure 3 (b) presents the

relative model performance on 10 classes in TerraIncognita-L100. Model performance variances

between classes are also noticeable. To clearly compare model specialty differences at the two levels,

we present heatmaps of specialty differences (measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence) for domain

and class pairs, respectively in Figure 3. The heatmaps exhibit a more pronounced divergence in

model specialty at the Ô¨Åner class level. It supports the necessity to utilize pretrained models on top of

taking their Ô¨Åne-grained specialty, in Ô¨Åner-grained level even on each sample, into account.

for domain generalization (SEDGE), with the motivation and speciÔ¨Åc details of the whole method.

We Ô¨Årst present the whole framework in Section 4.1 and then discuss the gathered pretrained models

in Section 4.2. After that, we introduce the model dispatcher with ensemble learning in Section 4.3

and the corresponding learning algorithm in Section 4.4.

4.1

Framework: Pretrained Model without Fine-tuning

Recall that the focus of the paper is on leveraging pretrained models without Ô¨Åne-tuning to cope

with domain generalization. As motivated in Section 3.2, each model has its own specialty and each

sample may require to choose a speciÔ¨Åc set of models to give a good prediction. As a result, we learn

the matching of pretrained models and samples from the source domains‚Äô training data.

Based on this idea, as illustrated in Figure 4, we propose a novel specialty-aware domain generaliza-

tion framework to dispatch an ensemble of specialized models for each sample. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a label

space adapter described in Section 3.2 is trained to transform the prediction of the pretrained models.

And then, an ensemble network is learned to dispatch the models in a model pool to each sample

according to their estimated specialty at sample level, and aggregate their outputs as an ensemble to

output the Ô¨Ånal prediction for each sample.

4.2

Pretrained Model Pool

This section presents the pretrained models used in SEDGE. With more and more pretrained models

being published, it is straightforward to build a pretrained model pool consisting of several public

pretrained models for direct adapting to novel domains.

On one hand, utilizing a ConvNet backbone [LeCun et al., 2015] pretrained on ImageNet is a common

practice of DG algorithms [Kim et al., 2021]. Based on that, we Ô¨Årst build Model Pool-A which

only contains 15 models pretrained on ImageNet for fair comparison with the existing algorithms.

In Model Pool-A, we incorporate the architectures including AlexNet (1) [Krizhevsky et al., 2012],

DenseNet-121/169/201 (3) [Iandola et al., 2014], Dual-Path-Network-68 (1) [Chen et al., 2017],

NASNetMobile (1) [Zoph et al., 2018], ResNet-18/34/50 (3) [He et al., 2016], SE-ResNet-50 (1) [Hu

et al., 2018], SqueezeNet-1.0/1.1 (2) [Iandola et al., 2016], and MAE-ViT-Base/Large/Huge (3) [He

et al., 2021] with pretrained weights1.

On the other hand, several DG algorithms also use models pretrained on other datasets, such as

1G-1B [Arpit et al., 2021] and ILSVRC12 [Thomas et al., 2021]. Therefore, we build Model Pool-B

which contains two more CLIP models [Radford et al., 2021], ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32, which are

trained on a subset of the YFCC100M dataset of roughly the same size as ImageNet. We denote

SEDGE using Model Pool-B as SEDGE+ to distinguish it from the one using Model Pool-A.

## Page 7

Note that, the models pretrained on the same dataset, i.e., ImageNet, will share the same label adapter

transforming the vanilla model outputs to the target label space.

4.3

Ensemble Network

As demonstrated by the Ô¨Åndings in Section 3.2, for generalizing to unseen domains, we need to take

advantage of each of the pretrained models with consideration of their specialties. Additionally, rather

than using one model to predict each sample, we propose to use an ensemble of multiple pretrained

models, which is known to bring less generalization error [Ueda and Nakano, 1996]. Moreover,

our method incorporates sample-level model specialty into consideration and conducts Ô¨Åne-grained

specialty-aware ensemble learning, which is novel comparing to the existing ensemble learning

methods as discussed in Section 2. This section will elaborate on the process of obtaining the most

specialized pretrained models for a given sample and aggregating the outputs of selected models

based on their specialty. The process can be divided into three steps as shown in Figure 4.

First, we embed the input sample and the available models to a hidden space. For an image sample

xi, we use a Ô¨Åxed pretrained model (i.e., ResNet-34 in our implementation) to embed xi to ei ‚ààRdq.

Meanwhile, we introduce a learnable latent variable Em ‚ààRK√ódm as model embedding dictionary

corresponding to the K models {fk}K

k=1, which is randomly initialized and optimized during training.

Furthermore, we map ei and Em to a joint latent space as

ci = œÉ(eiWi), Cm = œÉ(EmWm),

(1)

where Wi ‚ààRdq√ódv, Wm ‚ààRdm√ódv, and œÉ(¬∑) = max{¬∑, 0}. We then perform matrix multi-

plication of ci and Cm to calculate the matching score s = ciCT

m ‚ààRK between the sample

and each model. To dispatch each model output to the Ô¨Ånal prediction on the sample, we use

one layer multi-layer perceptron and perform softmax operation to output the ensemble weights

w = [w1, . . . , wK] ‚ààRK with wk equals to

wk =

e(Œ∂(W(s)))k

## Pk

j=1 e(Œ∂(W(s)))j ,

(2)

where W ‚ààRK√óK and Œ∂(¬∑) = log(1 + exp(¬∑)). Finally, the prediction for xi based on an ensemble

of K model outputs is written as

ÀÜyi =

## K

## X

k=1

wkhœÜ(fk(xi)), s.t.

## K

## X

k=1

wk = 1.

(3)

4.4

Learning Algorithm

As discussed above, the ensemble network acts as a model dispatcher through generating ensemble

weights to aggregate multiple model predictions for each sample. Section 3.2 shows that model

performance varies signiÔ¨Åcantly over samples. Thus, we expect to assign more weights to the models

with higher sample-level specialty to achieve the best utilization of the pretrained models. That is, we

try to minimize the estimation risk of the estimated model specialty on the ground truth, i.e., wk and

p(yi | xi; Œ∏‚Ä≤

k), as

Lc = ‚àí

## K

## X

k=1

[p (yi | xi; Œ∏‚Ä≤

k) ¬∑ ln(wk) + (1 ‚àíp (yi | xi; Œ∏‚Ä≤

k)) ¬∑ ln(1 ‚àíwk)] .

(4)

Lc is used to optimize the ensemble network to be a specialty-aware model dispatcher.

To train the general label space adapter hœÜ for all pretrained models, we incorporate the classiÔ¨Åcation

losses of adapted predictions of pretrained models

Lb =

## K

## X

k=1

wk ¬∑ l (hœÜ(fk(xi)), yi) ,

(5)

to update the shared adapter. Additionally, we use the classiÔ¨Åcation loss

Le = l (ÀÜyi, yi)

(6)

7

## Page 8

to optimize the likelihood of Ô¨Ånal ensemble output. Le is used to update both ensemble network and

adapter.

It is worth noting that the only parameters to update is the label space adapter and ensemble network,

each of which is lightweight compared to the pretrained models which remain Ô¨Åxed in our method

yet have been Ô¨Åne-tuned in the previous works.

Relation to weight ensemble. Previous methods, such as SWAD [Cha et al., 2021] and EoA [Arpit

et al., 2021], show that averaging model weights during training can avoid overÔ¨Åtting and achieve

better generalization performance. Their experimental results show superior performance compared

with methods without weight averaging. While in SEDGE, all pretrained model weights are not

involved in training. Accordingly, we perform weight averaging for adapter and ensemble network

starting from a certain iteration, which is served as a hyper-parameter.

Top-k model selection in inference. To save the inference time, we further select models with the

highest k ensemble weights and perform softmax on their ensemble weights for aggregation. In this

paper, we set k as 6.

Experiments

5.1

Evaluation Protocol

We conduct experiments on DomainBed suite [Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz, 2020], which provides

like-for-like comparisons between algorithms and has a standard evaluation protocol to follow.

Datasets. We experiment on 5 real-world benchmark datasets including PACS (4 domains, 9,991

samples, 7 classes) [Li et al., 2017], VLCS (4 domains, 10,729 samples, 5 classes) [Fang et al., 2013],

OfÔ¨ÅceHome (4 domains, 15,588 samples, 65 classes) [Venkateswara et al., 2017], TerraIncognita

(4 domains, 24,778 samples, 10 classes) [Beery et al., 2018], and DomainNet (6 domains, 586,575

samples, 345 classes) [Peng et al., 2019].

For fair comparison, we follow the training and evaluation protocol of DomainBed [Gulrajani

and Lopez-Paz, 2020]. We use the training-domain validation set protocol for model selection.

SpeciÔ¨Åcally, one domain in a dataset is selected as the target domain and the rest as source domains,

from which 20% of samples are used as the validation set. All runs are repeated 3 times using different

random seeds, thus, with different train-validation splits. The out-of-domain test performance

averaged over all domains will be reported for each dataset. In addition, we use the standard

number of iterations of 5,000 for all datasets, with early-stop based on validated accuracy to reduce

unnecessary computational costs.

Baselines. We compare SEDGE with some strong DG baselines including state-of-the-art. As

discussed in Section 2, some of the compared methods incorporate elaborate learning algorithms

including ERM [Vapnick, 1998], CORAL [Sun and Saenko, 2016], MLDG [Li et al., 2018a],

MMD [Li et al., 2018b], DANN [Ganin et al., 2016], C-DANN [Li et al., 2018c], and Fish [Shi et al.,

2021].

Some other works compared in our evaluation incorporate ensemble learning as listed as below.

‚Ä¢ Stochastic Weight Averaging Densely (SWAD) [Cha et al., 2021]: SWAD performs weight

ensemble during model training.

‚Ä¢ Ensemble of Average (EoA) [Arpit et al., 2021]: EoA combines both model ensemble and

weight ensemble by taking an ensemble of moving average models from 6 runs. They

experiment with two different pretrained models as initialization. One is pretrained on

ImageNet with ResNet-50 and the other is pretrained on both ImageNet and a much larger

additional dataset, IG-1B, with a more advanced backbone, ResNeXt-50 [Xie et al., 2017].

We denote the latter one as EoA+ to indicate it uses the additional dataset.

‚Ä¢ Random ensemble: In contrast to SEDGE of learning to select models for ensemble, we

also compare it with average ensemble of k models chosen randomly for each sample.

In addition, LP-FT [Kumar et al., 2021] reveals the generalization of pretrained models and proposes

an elaborated Ô¨Åne-tuning strategy. However, it does not follow the protocol of DomainBed and does

not provide implementation details for replication. Our runs for LP-FT show it performs worse than

DomainBed Benchmarking

This section presents experimental results on the DomainBed suite, with performance comparison

shown in Table 1 and training/inference time comparison in Table 2.

Comparison with Ô¨Åne-tuning paradigm. The main difference between previous algorithms and

SEDGE lies in Ô¨Åne-tuning or no Ô¨Åne-tuning on top of pretrained models. To verify whether the

dispatcher of Ô¨Åxed pretrained models can outperform Ô¨Åne-tuning paradigm, we conduct a comparison

of the algorithms that use models only pretrained on ImageNet, e.g., SEDGE using Model Pool-A.

As shown in Table 1, SEDGE achieves an average performance of 69.4%, exceeding SWAD by 2.5%.

Results show evidence that our novel paradigm is more effective than the traditional paradigm.

Performance beneÔ¨Åts from adding more pretrained models. SEDGE provides a feasible way

to incorporate the ever-emerging publicly available pretrained models. Although Model Pool-A

pretrained on ImageNet is in common use, Kumar et al. [2021] Ô¨Ånds that model pretrained on

ImageNet may not be good for datasets such as DomainNet. By using Model Pool-B that includes

models that have been pretrained on the CLIP dataset [Radford et al., 2021], SEDGE+ further

improves the average performance by 4.7% over SEDGE and ranks Ô¨Årst on all datasets. This

conÔ¨Årms that SEDGE paradigm is expected to generalize better on unseen domains by including

models pretrained on more diverse datasets in the model pool.

Training cost comparison. SEDGE only utilizes Ô¨Åxed pretrained models and learns to dispatch them

through a lightweight ensemble network with the help of a linear label space adapter. Therefore, the

number of learnable parameters of SEDGE (up to 0.6M) is minor compared with the normal image

backbone network (25.6M for ResNet-50). For fair training cost comparison, we run experiments of

ERM, SWAD, SEDGE on a single Nvidia Tesla V100 and compare their overall back-propagation

time from the start of training to the end (or early-stop). As shown in Table 2, training SEDGE

paradigm uses noticeably less time. SEDGE+ takes only 0.6% of the time of ERM on DomainNet.

The signiÔ¨Åcant training time advantage of the method and its surpassing performance suggest that

SEDGE is an effective and efÔ¨Åcient paradigm for domain generalization.

Inference cost comparison. As shown in Table 2, although ensemble methods like EoA and SEDGE

achieve better generalization performance at the cost of higher inference FLOPs, SEDGE still

manages to save a large amount of inference cost compared to the previous best ensemble model

(half of the inference FLOPs compared to EoA). This is because SEDGE only selects models with

the highest k(< K) ensemble weights. Therefore, only k of K models are activated for inference per

sample, which reduces the inference cost to a large extent.

Ablation Study

We want to verify the effectiveness of SEDGE design by answering two research questions: (Q1) Is

grafting a label space adapter on top of model outputs sufÔ¨Åcient, for utilizing pretrained models to

generalize to novel domains? (Q2) Is specialty-aware ensemble necessary, compared to an average

ensemble method?

To verify whether a single model with an adapter can perform well, we train an individual adapter on

source domains for each pretrained model in the model pool and compare their performance on target

domain with state-of-the-art DG algorithm. To show the ‚Äúcheating‚Äù upper bound of performance

under this ablation study, we report the best single model performance on test set as best single

model + adapter. As shown in Table 3, the best single model + adapter among Model Pool-A can

outperform SWAD only on OfÔ¨ÅceHome. It Ô¨Årst indicates that the generalization ability of the Ô¨Åxed

pretrained models may be more promising than model with Ô¨Åne-tuning on speciÔ¨Åc domains. However,

in other four datasets, it lags behind SWAD by a large margin. This demonstrates a single pretrained

model with a label space adapter is not sufÔ¨Åcient to generalize to unseen domains, which motivates

the main contribution of our method of introducing ensemble learning.

DG algorithms that combine ensemble learning, such as SWAD and EoA, demonstrate promising

performance. A natural question is whether using an ensemble of pretrained models rather than a

single model can improve performance. Following the ensemble approaches [Lakshminarayanan

et al., 2017] using mean average, we experiment a random ensemble over the Ô¨Åxed pretrained models,

i.e., randomly sampling k models for each sample and averaging their outputs for Ô¨Ånal prediction.

The results are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, random ensemble results in worse performance

than the single model, while SEDGE with specialty-aware ensemble boosts the Ô¨Ånal performance

signiÔ¨Åcantly, albeit with strong or weak individual model performance, which veriÔ¨Åes the necessity

to select and ensemble the pretrained models based on their specialty over samples as mentioned in

Section 3.2 (Q2).

5.4

Further Analysis

As shown in Figure 3, model performance varies across domains, while SEDGE is designed to

dispatch specialized models for samples. To analyze whether SEDGE is handling as expected, we

present its domain-level model assignment on different domains of TerraIncognita. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we

calculate the sum of ensemble weights assigned to a model as an evaluation of its importance. In

Figure 5, we show the rankings of model importance on different domains. By comparing ranking

between different domains, it can be seen that SEDGE dispatches models quite differently over

unseen target domains. For example, while CLIP-ViT-B/32 model is used frequently on L38/43/46

datasets, it lags behind other models on L100. It suggests that SEDGE is making rational model

selection as Figure 3 shows CLIP-ViT-B/32 is not a powerful model on this domain. Since the target

domain is not known prior to making predictions, SEDGE learns to Ô¨Ånd suitable models for each

sample by learning on source domains only.

Conclusions

Domain generalization algorithms use the pretrained model as initialization for Ô¨Åne-tuning, while

a few works have found that Ô¨Åne-tuning may lead to out-of-distribution performance degradation.

Different from the previous Ô¨Åne-tuning paradigm, this paper proposes a novel paradigm for domain

generalization, specialized ensemble learning which learns to dispatch an ensemble of Ô¨Åxed pretrained

models for each sample based on the model specialty on it. Experiments on Ô¨Åve benchmark datasets

show that our proposed method has achieved state-of-the-art performance with signiÔ¨Åcant training

cost reduction.
