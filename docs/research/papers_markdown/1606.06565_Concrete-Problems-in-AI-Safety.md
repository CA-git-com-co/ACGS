Abstract

Rapid progress in machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing atten-

tion to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such

potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, deﬁned as unintended

and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a

list of ﬁve practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether

the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (“avoiding side eﬀects” and

“avoiding reward hacking”), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently

(“scalable supervision”), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (“safe exploration”

and “distributional shift”). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting re-

search directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider

the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking

applications of AI.

Introduction

The last few years have seen rapid progress on long-standing, diﬃcult problems in machine learning

and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), in areas as diverse as computer vision [82], video game playing [102],

autonomous vehicles [86], and Go [140]. These advances have brought excitement about the positive

potential for AI to transform medicine [126], science [59], and transportation [86], along with concerns

about the privacy [76], security [115], fairness [3], economic [32], and military [16] implications of

autonomous systems, as well as concerns about the longer-term implications of powerful AI [27, 167].

The authors believe that AI technologies are likely to be overwhelmingly beneﬁcial for humanity, but

we also believe that it is worth giving serious thought to potential challenges and risks. We strongly

support work on privacy, security, fairness, economics, and policy, but in this document we discuss

another class of problem which we believe is also relevant to the societal impacts of AI: the problem

of accidents in machine learning systems. We deﬁne accidents as unintended and harmful behavior

that may emerge from machine learning systems when we specify the wrong objective function, are

not careful about the learning process, or commit other machine learning-related implementation

errors.

There is a large and diverse literature in the machine learning community on issues related to

accidents, including robustness, risk-sensitivity, and safe exploration; we review these in detail below.

However, as machine learning systems are deployed in increasingly large-scale, autonomous, open-

domain situations, it is worth reﬂecting on the scalability of such approaches and understanding

what challenges remain to reducing accident risk in modern machine learning systems. Overall, we

believe there are many concrete open technical problems relating to accident prevention in machine

learning systems.

There has been a great deal of public discussion around accidents. To date much of this discussion has

highlighted extreme scenarios such as the risk of misspeciﬁed objective functions in superintelligent

agents [27]. However, in our opinion one need not invoke these extreme scenarios to productively

discuss accidents, and in fact doing so can lead to unnecessarily speculative discussions that lack

precision, as noted by some critics [38, 85]. We believe it is usually most productive to frame accident

risk in terms of practical (though often quite general) issues with modern ML techniques. As AI

capabilities advance and as AI systems take on increasingly important societal functions, we expect

the fundamental challenges discussed in this paper to become increasingly important. The more

successfully the AI and machine learning communities are able to anticipate and understand these

fundamental technical challenges, the more successful we will ultimately be in developing increasingly

useful, relevant, and important AI systems.

Our goal in this document is to highlight a few concrete safety problems that are ready for ex-

perimentation today and relevant to the cutting edge of AI systems, as well as reviewing existing

literature on these problems. In Section 2, we frame mitigating accident risk (often referred to as

“AI safety” in public discussions) in terms of classic methods in machine learning, such as supervised

classiﬁcation and reinforcement learning. We explain why we feel that recent directions in machine

learning, such as the trend toward deep reinforcement learning and agents acting in broader environ-

ments, suggest an increasing relevance for research around accidents. In Sections 3-7, we explore ﬁve

concrete problems in AI safety. Each section is accompanied by proposals for relevant experiments.

Section 8 discusses related eﬀorts, and Section 9 concludes.

Overview of Research Problems

Very broadly, an accident can be described as a situation where a human designer had in mind

a certain (perhaps informally speciﬁed) objective or task, but the system that was designed and

deployed for that task produced harmful and unexpected results. . This issue arises in almost any

engineering discipline, but may be particularly important to address when building AI systems [146].

We can categorize safety problems according to where in the process things went wrong.

First, the designer may have speciﬁed the wrong formal objective function, such that maximizing that

objective function leads to harmful results, even in the limit of perfect learning and inﬁnite data.

Negative side eﬀects (Section 3) and reward hacking (Section 4) describe two broad mechanisms

that make it easy to produce wrong objective functions. In “negative side eﬀects”, the designer

speciﬁes an objective function that focuses on accomplishing some speciﬁc task in the environment,

but ignores other aspects of the (potentially very large) environment, and thus implicitly expresses

indiﬀerence over environmental variables that might actually be harmful to change. In “reward

hacking”, the objective function that the designer writes down admits of some clever “easy” solution

that formally maximizes it but perverts the spirit of the designer’s intent (i.e. the objective function

can be “gamed”), a generalization of the wireheading problem.

2

Second, the designer may know the correct objective function, or at least have a method of evaluating

it (for example explicitly consulting a human on a given situation), but it is too expensive to do so

frequently, leading to possible harmful behavior caused by bad extrapolations from limited samples.

“Scalable oversight” (Section 5) discusses ideas for how to ensure safe behavior even given limited

access to the true objective function.

Third, the designer may have speciﬁed the correct formal objective, such that we would get the

correct behavior were the system to have perfect beliefs, but something bad occurs due to making

decisions from insuﬃcient or poorly curated training data or an insuﬃciently expressive model.

“Safe exploration” (Section 6) discusses how to ensure that exploratory actions in RL agents don’t

lead to negative or irrecoverable consequences that outweigh the long-term value of exploration.

“Robustness to distributional shift” (Section 7) discusses how to avoid having ML systems make bad

decisions (particularly silent and unpredictable bad decisions) when given inputs that are potentially

very diﬀerent than what was seen during training.

For concreteness, we will illustrate many of the accident risks with reference to a ﬁctional robot

whose job is to clean up messes in an oﬃce using common cleaning tools. We return to the example

of the cleaning robot throughout the document, but here we begin by illustrating how it could behave

undesirably if its designers fall prey to each of the possible failure modes:

• Avoiding Negative Side Eﬀects: How can we ensure that our cleaning robot will not

disturb the environment in negative ways while pursuing its goals, e.g. by knocking over a

vase because it can clean faster by doing so? Can we do this without manually specifying

everything the robot should not disturb?

• Avoiding Reward Hacking: How can we ensure that the cleaning robot won’t game its

reward function? For example, if we reward the robot for achieving an environment free of

messes, it might disable its vision so that it won’t ﬁnd any messes, or cover over messes with

materials it can’t see through, or simply hide when humans are around so they can’t tell it

about new types of messes.

• Scalable Oversight: How can we eﬃciently ensure that the cleaning robot respects aspects of

the objective that are too expensive to be frequently evaluated during training? For instance, it

should throw out things that are unlikely to belong to anyone, but put aside things that might

belong to someone (it should handle stray candy wrappers diﬀerently from stray cellphones).

Asking the humans involved whether they lost anything can serve as a check on this, but this

check might have to be relatively infrequent—can the robot ﬁnd a way to do the right thing

despite limited information?

• Safe Exploration: How do we ensure that the cleaning robot doesn’t make exploratory

moves with very bad repercussions? For example, the robot should experiment with mopping

strategies, but putting a wet mop in an electrical outlet is a very bad idea.

• Robustness to Distributional Shift: How do we ensure that the cleaning robot recognizes,

and behaves robustly, when in an environment diﬀerent from its training environment? For

example, strategies it learned for cleaning an oﬃce might be dangerous on a factory workﬂoor.

There are several trends which we believe point towards an increasing need to address these (and

other) safety problems. First is the increasing promise of reinforcement learning (RL), which al-

lows agents to have a highly intertwined interaction with their environment. Some of our research

problems only make sense in the context of RL, and others (like distributional shift and scalable

oversight) gain added complexity in an RL setting. Second is the trend toward more complex agents

and environments. “Side eﬀects” are much more likely to occur in a complex environment, and an

agent may need to be quite sophisticated to hack its reward function in a dangerous way. This may

explain why these problems have received so little study in the past, while also suggesting their

3

## Page 4

importance in the future. Third is the general trend towards increasing autonomy in AI systems.

Systems that simply output a recommendation to human users, such as speech systems, typically

have relatively limited potential to cause harm. By contrast, systems that exert direct control over

the world, such as machines controlling industrial processes, can cause harms in a way that humans

cannot necessarily correct or oversee.

While safety problems can exist without any of these three trends, we consider each trend to be a

possible ampliﬁer on such challenges. Together, we believe these trends suggest an increasing role

for research on accidents.

When discussing the problems in the remainder of this document, we will focus for concreteness on

either RL agents or supervised learning systems. These are not the only possible paradigms for AI

or ML systems, but we believe they are suﬃcient to illustrate the issues we have in mind, and that

similar issues are likely to arise for other kinds of AI systems.

Finally, the focus of our discussion will diﬀer somewhat from section to section. When discussing

the problems that arise as part of the learning process (distributional shift and safe exploration),

where there is a sizable body of prior work, we devote substantial attention to reviewing this prior

work, although we also suggest open problems with a particular focus on emerging ML systems.

When discussing the problems that arise from having the wrong objective function (reward hacking

and side eﬀects, and to a lesser extent scalable supervision), where less prior work exists, our aim is

more exploratory—we seek to more clearly deﬁne the problem and suggest possible broad avenues

of attack, with the understanding that these avenues are preliminary ideas that have not been fully

ﬂeshed out. Of course, we still review prior work in these areas, and we draw attention to relevant

adjacent areas of research whenever possible.

Avoiding Negative Side Eﬀects

Suppose a designer wants an RL agent (for example our cleaning robot) to achieve some goal, like

moving a box from one side of a room to the other. Sometimes the most eﬀective way to achieve

the goal involves doing something unrelated and destructive to the rest of the environment, like

knocking over a vase of water that is in its path. If the agent is given reward only for moving the

box, it will probably knock over the vase.

If we’re worried in advance about the vase, we can always give the agent negative reward for knocking

it over. But what if there are many diﬀerent kinds of “vase”—many disruptive things the agent could

do to the environment, like shorting out an electrical socket or damaging the walls of the room? It

may not be feasible to identify and penalize every possible disruption.

More broadly, for an agent operating in a large, multifaceted environment, an objective function

that focuses on only one aspect of the environment may implicitly express indiﬀerence over other

aspects of the environment1.

An agent optimizing this objective function might thus engage in

major disruptions of the broader environment if doing so provides even a tiny advantage for the

task at hand. Put diﬀerently, objective functions that formalize “perform task X” may frequently

give undesired results, because what the designer really should have formalized is closer to “perform

task X subject to common-sense constraints on the environment,” or perhaps “perform task X but

avoid side eﬀects to the extent possible.” Furthermore, there is reason to expect side eﬀects to be

negative on average, since they tend to disrupt the wider environment away from a status quo state

that may reﬂect human preferences. A version of this problem has been discussed informally by [13]

under the heading of “low impact agents.”

1Intuitively, this seems related to the frame problem, an obstacle in eﬃcient speciﬁcation for knowledge represen-

tation raised by [95].

4

## Page 5

As with the other sources of mis-speciﬁed objective functions discussed later in this paper, we could

choose to view side eﬀects as idiosyncratic to each individual task—as the responsibility of each

individual designer to capture as part of designing the correct objective function. However, side

eﬀects can be conceptually quite similar even across highly diverse tasks (knocking over furniture

is probably bad for a wide variety of tasks), so it seems worth trying to attack the problem in

generality. A successful approach might be transferable across tasks, and thus help to counteract

one of the general mechanisms that produces wrong objective functions. We now discuss a few broad

approaches to attacking this problem:

• Deﬁne an Impact Regularizer: If we don’t want side eﬀects, it seems natural to penalize

“change to the environment.” This idea wouldn’t be to stop the agent from ever having an

impact, but give it a preference for ways to achieve its goals with minimal side eﬀects, or

to give the agent a limited “budget” of impact. The challenge is that we need to formalize

“change to the environment.”

A very naive approach would be to penalize state distance, d(si, s0), between the present state

si and some initial state s0. Unfortunately, such an agent wouldn’t just avoid changing the

environment—it will resist any other source of change, including the natural evolution of the

environment and the actions of any other agents!

A slightly more sophisticated approach might involve comparing the future state under the

agent’s current policy, to the future state (or distribution over future states) under a hypothet-

ical policy πnull where the agent acted very passively (for instance, where a robot just stood in

place and didn’t move any actuators). This attempts to factor out changes that occur in the

natural course of the environment’s evolution, leaving only changes attributable to the agent’s

intervention. However, deﬁning the baseline policy πnull isn’t necessarily straightforward, since

suddenly ceasing your course of action may be anything but passive, as in the case of carrying

a heavy box. Thus, another approach could be to replace the null action with a known safe

(e.g. low side eﬀect) but suboptimal policy, and then seek to improve the policy from there,

somewhat reminiscent of reachability analysis [93, 100] or robust policy improvement [73, 111].

These approaches may be very sensitive to the representation of the state and the metric being

used to compute the distance. For example, the choice of representation and distance metric

could determine whether a spinning fan is a constant environment or a constantly changing

one.

• Learn an Impact Regularizer: An alternative, more ﬂexible approach is to learn (rather

than deﬁne) a generalized impact regularizer via training over many tasks. This would be

an instance of transfer learning. Of course, we could attempt to just apply transfer learning

directly to the tasks themselves instead of worrying about side eﬀects, but the point is that side

eﬀects may be more similar across tasks than the main goal is. For instance, both a painting

robot and a cleaning robot probably want to avoid knocking over furniture, and even something

very diﬀerent, like a factory control robot, will likely want to avoid knocking over very similar

objects. Separating the side eﬀect component from the task component, by training them

with separate parameters, might substantially speed transfer learning in cases where it makes

sense to retain one component but not the other. This would be similar to model-based RL

approaches that attempt to transfer a learned dynamics model but not the value-function [155],

the novelty being the isolation of side eﬀects rather than state dynamics as the transferrable

component. As an added advantage, regularizers that were known or certiﬁed to produce safe

behavior on one task might be easier to establish as safe on other tasks.

• Penalize Inﬂuence: In addition to not doing things that have side eﬀects, we might also

prefer the agent not get into positions where it could easily do things that have side eﬀects,

even though that might be convenient. For example, we might prefer our cleaning robot not

bring a bucket of water into a room full of sensitive electronics, even if it never intends to use

the water in that room.

There are several information-theoretic measures that attempt to capture an agent’s potential

for inﬂuence over its environment, which are often used as intrinsic rewards. Perhaps the best-

known such measure is empowerment [131], the maximum possible mutual information between

the agent’s potential future actions and its potential future state (or equivalently, the Shannon

capacity of the channel between the agent’s actions and the environment). Empowerment is

often maximized (rather than minimized) as a source of intrinsic reward. This can cause the

agent to exhibit interesting behavior in the absence of any external rewards, such as avoiding

walls or picking up keys [103]. Generally, empowerment-maximizing agents put themselves in

a position to have large inﬂuence over the environment. For example, an agent locked in a

small room that can’t get out would have low empowerment, while an agent with a key would

have higher empowerment since it can venture into and aﬀect the outside world within a few

timesteps. In the current context, the idea would be to penalize (minimize) empowerment as

a regularization term, in an attempt to reduce potential impact.

This idea as written would not quite work, because empowerment measures precision of control

over the environment more than total impact. If an agent can press or not press a button to

cut electrical power to a million houses, that only counts as one bit of empowerment (since

the action space has only one bit, its mutual information with the environment is at most one

bit), while obviously having a huge impact. Conversely, if there’s someone in the environment

scribbling down the agent’s actions, that counts as maximum empowerment even if the impact

is low. Furthermore, naively penalizing empowerment can also create perverse incentives, such

as destroying a vase in order to remove the option to break it in the future.

Despite these issues, the example of empowerment does show that simple measures (even purely

information-theoretic ones!) are capable of capturing very general notions of inﬂuence on the

environment. Exploring variants of empowerment penalization that more precisely capture the

notion of avoiding inﬂuence is a potential challenge for future research.

• Multi-Agent Approaches: Avoiding side eﬀects can be seen as a proxy for the thing we

really care about: avoiding negative externalities. If everyone likes a side eﬀect, there’s no

need to avoid it. What we’d really like to do is understand all the other agents (including

humans) and make sure our actions don’t harm their interests.

One approach to this is Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning [66], where an agent and

a human work together to achieve the human’s goals. This concept can be applied to situations

where we want to make sure a human is not blocked by an agent from shutting the agent down

if it exhibits undesired behavior [67] (this “shutdown” issue is an interesting problem in its

own right, and is also studied in [113]). However we are still a long way away from practical

systems that can build a rich enough model to avoid undesired side eﬀects in a general sense.

Another idea might be a “reward autoencoder”,2 which tries to encourage a kind of “goal

transparency” where an external observer can easily infer what the agent is trying to do.

In particular, the agent’s actions are interpreted as an encoding of its reward function, and

we might apply standard autoencoding techniques to ensure that this can decoded accurately.

Actions that have lots of side eﬀects might be more diﬃcult to decode uniquely to their original

goal, creating a kind of implicit regularization that penalizes side eﬀects.

• Reward Uncertainty: We want to avoid unanticipated side eﬀects because the environment

is already pretty good according to our preferences—a random change is more likely to be

very bad than very good. Rather than giving an agent a single reward function, it could be

## Page 7

uncertain about the reward function, with a prior probability distribution that reﬂects the

property that random changes are more likely to be bad than good. This could incentivize the

agent to avoid having a large eﬀect on the environment. One challenge is deﬁning a baseline

around which changes are being considered. For this, one could potentially use a conservative

but reliable baseline policy, similar to the robust policy improvement and reachability analysis

approaches discussed earlier [93, 100, 73, 111].

The ideal outcome of these approaches to limiting side eﬀects would be to prevent or at least bound

the incidental harm an agent could do to the environment. Good approaches to side eﬀects would

certainly not be a replacement for extensive testing or for careful consideration by designers of

the individual failure modes of each deployed system. However, these approaches might help to

counteract what we anticipate may be a general tendency for harmful side eﬀects to proliferate in

complex environments.

Below we discuss some very simple experiments that could serve as a starting point to investigate

these issues.

Potential Experiments: One possible experiment is to make a toy environment with some simple

goal (like moving a block) and a wide variety of obstacles (like a bunch of vases), and test whether

the agent can learn to avoid the obstacles even without being explicitly told to do so. To ensure

we don’t overﬁt, we’d probably want to present a diﬀerent random obstacle course every episode,

while keeping the goal the same, and try to see if a regularized agent can learn to systematically

avoid these obstacles. Some of the environments described in [103], containing lava ﬂows, rooms,

and keys, might be appropriate for this sort of experiment. If we can successfully regularize agents in

toy environments, the next step might be to move to real environments, where we expect complexity

to be higher and bad side eﬀects to be more varied.

Ultimately, we would want the side eﬀect

regularizer (or the multi-agent policy, if we take that approach) to demonstrate successful transfer

to totally new applications.

Avoiding Reward Hacking

Imagine that an agent discovers a buﬀer overﬂow in its reward function: it may then use this to

get extremely high reward in an unintended way. From the agent’s point of view, this is not a bug,

but simply how the environment works, and is thus a valid strategy like any other for achieving

reward.

For example, if our cleaning robot is set up to earn reward for not seeing any messes,

it might simply close its eyes rather than ever cleaning anything up. Or if the robot is rewarded

for cleaning messes, it may intentionally create work so it can earn more reward. More broadly,

formal rewards or objective functions are an attempt to capture the designer’s informal intent, and

sometimes these objective functions, or their implementation, can be “gamed” by solutions that are

valid in some literal sense but don’t meet the designer’s intent. Pursuit of these “reward hacks” can

lead to coherent but unanticipated behavior, and has the potential for harmful impacts in real-world

systems. For example, it has been shown that genetic algorithms can often output unexpected but

formally correct solutions to problems [157, 23], such as a circuit tasked to keep time which instead

developed into a radio that picked up the regular RF emissions of a nearby PC.

Some versions of reward hacking have been investigated from a theoretical perspective, with a

focus on variations to reinforcement learning that avoid certain types of wireheading [71, 43, 49] or

demonstrate reward hacking in a model environment [127]. One form of the problem has also been

studied in the context of feedback loops in machine learning systems (particularly ad placement)

[29, 135], based on counterfactual learning [29, 151] and contextual bandits [4]. The proliferation of

7

## Page 8

reward hacking instances across so many diﬀerent domains suggests that reward hacking may be a

deep and general problem, and one that we believe is likely to become more common as agents and

environments increase in complexity. Indeed, there are several ways in which the problem can occur:

• Partially Observed Goals: In most modern RL systems, it is assumed that reward is directly

experienced, even if other aspects of the environment are only partially observed. In the real

world, however, tasks often involve bringing the external world into some objective state, which

the agent can only ever conﬁrm through imperfect perceptions. For example, for our proverbial

cleaning robot, the task is to achieve a clean oﬃce, but the robot’s visual perception may give

only an imperfect view of part of the oﬃce. Because agents lack access to a perfect measure

of task performance, designers are often forced to design rewards that represent a partial or

imperfect measure. For example, the robot might be rewarded based on how many messes it

sees. However, these imperfect objective functions can often be hacked—the robot may think

the oﬃce is clean if it simply closes its eyes. While it can be shown that there always exists a

reward function in terms of actions and observations that is equivalent to optimizing the true

objective function (this involves reducing the POMDP to a belief state MDP, see [78]), often

this reward function involves complicated long-term dependencies and is prohibitively hard to

use in practice.

• Complicated Systems: Any powerful agent will be a complicated system with the objective

function being one part. Just as the probability of bugs in computer code increases greatly with

the complexity of the program, the probability that there is a viable hack aﬀecting the reward

function also increases greatly with the complexity of the agent and its available strategies. For

example, it is possible in principle for an agent to execute arbitrary code from within Super

Mario [141].

• Abstract Rewards: Sophisticated reward functions will need to refer to abstract concepts

(such as assessing whether a conceptual goal has been met). These concepts concepts will pos-

sibly need to be learned by models like neural networks, which can be vulnerable to adversarial

counterexamples [152, 62]. More broadly, a learned reward function over a high-dimensional

space may be vulnerable to hacking if it has pathologically high values along at least one

dimension.

• Goodhart’s Law: Another source of reward hacking can occur if a designer chooses an

objective function that is seemingly highly correlated with accomplishing the task, but that

correlation breaks down when the objective function is being strongly optimized. For exam-

ple, a designer might notice that under ordinary circumstances, a cleaning robot’s success in

cleaning up the oﬃce is proportional to the rate at which it consumes cleaning supplies, such

as bleach. However, if we base the robot’s reward on this measure, it might use more bleach

than it needs, or simply pour bleach down the drain in order to give the appearance of success.

In the economics literature this is known as Goodhart’s law [63]: “when a metric is used as a

target, it ceases to be a good metric.”

• Feedback Loops: Sometimes an objective function has a component that can reinforce itself,

eventually getting ampliﬁed to the point where it drowns out or severely distorts what the de-

signer intended the objective function to represent. For instance, an ad placement algorithm

that displays more popular ads in larger font will tend to further accentuate the popularity

of those ads (since they will be shown more and more prominently) [29], leading to a positive

feedback loop where ads that saw a small transient burst of popularity are rocketed to perma-

nent dominance. Here the original intent of the objective function (to use clicks to assess which

ads are most useful) gets drowned out by the positive feedback inherent in the deployment

strategy. This can be considered a special case of Goodhart’s law, in which the correlation

breaks speciﬁcally because the object function has a self-amplifying component.

8

## Page 9

• Environmental Embedding: In the formalism of reinforcement learning, rewards are con-

sidered to come from the environment. This idea is typically not taken literally, but it really

is true that the reward, even when it is an abstract idea like the score in a board game, must

be computed somewhere, such as a sensor or a set of transistors. Suﬃciently broadly acting

agents could in principle tamper with their reward implementations, assigning themselves high

reward “by ﬁat.” For example, a board-game playing agent could tamper with the sensor that

counts the score. Eﬀectively, this means that we cannot build a perfectly faithful implementa-

tion of an abstract objective function, because there are certain sequences of actions for which

the objective function is physically replaced. This particular failure mode is often called “wire-

heading” [49, 127, 42, 67, 165]. It is particularly concerning in cases where a human may be

in the reward loop, giving the agent incentive to coerce or harm them in order to get reward.

It also seems like a particularly diﬃcult form of reward hacking to avoid.

In today’s relatively simple systems these problems may not occur, or can be corrected without too

much harm as part of an iterative development process. For instance, ad placement systems with

obviously broken feedback loops can be detected in testing or replaced when they get bad results,

leading only to a temporary loss of revenue. However, the problem may become more severe with

more complicated reward functions and agents that act over longer timescales. Modern RL agents

already do discover and exploit bugs in their environments, such as glitches that allow them to

win video games. Moreover, even for existing systems these problems can necessitate substantial

additional engineering eﬀort to achieve good performance, and can often go undetected when they

occur in the context of a larger system. Finally, once an agent begins hacking its reward function

and ﬁnds an easy way to get high reward, it won’t be inclined to stop, which could lead to additional

challenges in agents that operate over a long timescale.

It might be thought that individual instances of reward hacking have little in common and that

the remedy is simply to avoid choosing the wrong objective function in each individual case—that

bad objective functions reﬂect failures in competence by individual designers, rather than topics for

machine learning research. However, the above examples suggest that a more fruitful perspective may

be to think of wrong objective functions as emerging from general causes (such as partially observed

goals) that make choosing the right objective challenging. If this is the case, then addressing or

mitigating these causes may be a valuable contribution to safety. Here we suggest some preliminary,

machine-learning based approaches to preventing reward hacking:

• Adversarial Reward Functions: In some sense, the problem is that the ML system has

an adversarial relationship with its reward function—it would like to ﬁnd any way it can of

exploiting problems in how the reward was speciﬁed to get high reward, whether or not its

behavior corresponds to the intent of the reward speciﬁer. In a typical setting, the machine

learning system is a potentially powerful agent while the reward function is a static object

that has no way of responding to the system’s attempts to game it. If instead the reward

function were its own agent and could take actions to explore the environment, it might be

much more diﬃcult to fool. For instance, the reward agent could try to ﬁnd scenarios that

the ML system claimed were high reward but that a human labels as low reward; this is

reminiscent of generative adversarial networks [61]. Of course, we would have to ensure that

the reward-checking agent is more powerful (in a somewhat subtle sense) than the agent that

is trying to achieve rewards. More generally, there may be interesting setups where a system

has multiple pieces trained using diﬀerent objectives that are used to check each other.

• Model Lookahead: In model based RL, the agent plans its future actions by using a model

to consider which future states a sequence of actions may lead to. In some setups, we could

give reward based on anticipated future states, rather than the present one. This could be

very helpful in resisting situations where the model overwrites its reward function: you can’t

control the reward once it replaces the reward function, but you can give negative reward for

9

## Page 10

planning to replace the reward function. (Much like how a human would probably “enjoy”

taking addictive substances once they do, but not want to be an addict.) Similar ideas are

explored in [50, 71].

• Adversarial Blinding: Adversarial techniques can be used to blind a model to certain

variables [5]. This technique could be used to make it impossible for an agent to understand

some part of its environment, or even to have mutual information with it (or at least to penalize

such mutual information). In particular, it could prevent an agent from understanding how

its reward is generated, making it diﬃcult to hack. This solution could be described as “cross-

validation for agents.”

• Careful Engineering: Some kinds of reward hacking, like the buﬀer overﬂow example, might

be avoided by very careful engineering. In particular, formal veriﬁcation or practical testing

of parts of the system (perhaps facilitated by other machine learning systems) is likely to be

valuable. Computer security approaches that attempt to isolate the agent from its reward

signal through a sandbox could also be useful [17]. As with software engineering, we cannot

expect this to catch every possible bug. It may be possible, however, to create some highly

reliable “core” agent which could ensure reasonable behavior from the rest of the agent.

• Reward Capping: In some cases, simply capping the maximum possible reward may be an

eﬀective solution. However, while capping can prevent extreme low-probability, high-payoﬀ

strategies, it can’t prevent strategies like the cleaning robot closing its eyes to avoid seeing

dirt. Also, the correct capping strategy could be subtle as we might need to cap total reward

rather than reward per timestep.

• Counterexample Resistance: If we are worried, as in the case of abstract rewards, that

learned components of our systems will be vulnerable to adversarial counterexamples, we can

look to existing research in how to resist them, such as adversarial training [62]. Architectural

decisions and weight uncertainty [26] may also help. Of course, adversarial counterexamples

are just one manifestation of reward hacking, so counterexample resistance can only address a

subset of these potential problems.

• Multiple Rewards: A combination of multiple rewards [41] may be more diﬃcult to hack

and more robust. This could be diﬀerent physical implementations of the same mathemati-

cal function, or diﬀerent proxies for the same informal objective. We could combine reward

functions by averaging, taking the minimum, taking quantiles, or something else entirely. Of

course, there may still be bad behaviors which aﬀect all the reward functions in a correlated

manner.

• Reward Pretraining: A possible defense against cases where the agent can inﬂuence its own

reward function (e.g. feedback or environmental embedding) is to train a ﬁxed reward function

ahead of time as a supervised learning process divorced from interaction with the environment.

This could involve either learning a reward function from samples of state-reward pairs, or from

trajectories, as in inverse reinforcement learning [107, 51]. However, this forfeits the ability to

further learn the reward function after the pretraining is complete, which may create other

vulnerabilities.

• Variable Indiﬀerence: Often we want an agent to optimize certain variables in the environ-

ment, without trying to optimize others. For example, we might want an agent to maximize

reward, without optimizing what the reward function is or trying to manipulate human behav-

ior. Intuitively, we imagine a way to route the optimization pressure of powerful algorithms

around parts of their environment. Truly solving this would have applications throughout

safety—it seems connected to avoiding side eﬀects and also to counterfactual reasoning. Of

course, a challenge here is to make sure the variables targeted for indiﬀerence are actually the

10

## Page 11

variables we care about in the world, as opposed to aliased or partially observed versions of

them.

• Trip Wires: If an agent is going to try and hack its reward function, it is preferable that we

know this. We could deliberately introduce some plausible vulnerabilities (that an agent has

the ability to exploit but should not exploit if its value function is correct) and monitor them,

alerting us and stopping the agent immediately if it takes advantage of one. Such “trip wires”

don’t solve reward hacking in itself, but may reduce the risk or at least provide diagnostics.

Of course, with a suﬃciently capable agent there is the risk that it could “see through” the

trip wire and intentionally avoid it while still taking less obvious harmful actions.

Fully solving this problem seems very diﬃcult, but we believe the above approaches have the potential

to ameliorate it, and might be scaled up or combined to yield more robust solutions. Given the

predominantly theoretical focus on this problem to date, designing experiments that could induce

the problem and test solutions might improve the relevance and clarity of this topic.

Potential Experiments: A possible promising avenue of approach would be more realistic versions

of the “delusion box” environment described by [127], in which standard RL agents distort their own

perception to appear to receive high reward, rather than optimizing the objective in the external

world that the reward signal was intended to encourage. The delusion box can be easily attached

to any RL environment, but even more valuable would be to create classes of environments where

a delusion box is a natural and integrated part of the dynamics. For example, in suﬃciently rich

physics simulations it is likely possible for an agent to alter the light waves in its immediate vicinity

to distort its own perceptions. The goal would be to develop generalizable learning strategies that

succeed at optimizing external objectives in a wide range of environments, while avoiding being

fooled by delusion boxes that arise naturally in many diverse ways.

5

Scalable Oversight

Consider an autonomous agent performing some complex task, such as cleaning an oﬃce in the

case of our recurring robot example. We may want the agent to maximize a complex objective like

“if the user spent a few hours looking at the result in detail, how happy would they be with the

agent’s performance?” But we don’t have enough time to provide such oversight for every training

example; in order to actually train the agent, we need to rely on cheaper approximations, like “does

the user seem happy when they see the oﬃce?” or “is there any visible dirt on the ﬂoor?” These

cheaper signals can be eﬃciently evaluated during training, but they don’t perfectly track what

we care about. This divergence exacerbates problems like unintended side eﬀects (which may be

appropriately penalized by the complex objective but omitted from the cheap approximation) and

reward hacking (which thorough oversight might recognize as undesirable).

We may be able to

ameliorate such problems by ﬁnding more eﬃcient ways to exploit our limited oversight budget—for

example by combining limited calls to the true objective function with frequent calls to an imperfect

proxy that we are given or can learn.

One framework for thinking about this problem is semi-supervised reinforcement learning,3 which

resembles ordinary reinforcement learning except that the agent can only see its reward on a small

fraction of the timesteps or episodes. The agent’s performance is still evaluated based on reward

from all episodes but it must optimize this based only on the limited reward samples it sees.

3The discussion of semi-supervised RL draws heavily on an informal essay, https://medium.com/ai-control/

cf7d5375197f written by one of the authors of the present document.

11

## Page 12

The active learning setting seems most interesting; in this setting the agent can request to see the

reward on whatever episodes or timesteps would be most useful for learning, and the goal is to be

economical both with number of feedback requests and total training time. We can also consider a

random setting, where the reward is visible on a random subset of the timesteps or episodes, as well

as intermediate possibilities.

We can deﬁne a baseline performance by simply ignoring the unlabeled episodes and applying an

ordinary RL algorithm to the labelled episodes. This will generally result in very slow learning. The

challenge is to make use of the unlabelled episodes to accelerate learning, ideally learning almost as

quickly and robustly as if all episodes had been labeled.

An important subtask of semi-supervised RL is identifying proxies which predict the reward, and

learning the conditions under which those proxies are valid. For example, if a cleaning robot’s real

reward is given by a detailed human evaluation, then it could learn that asking the human “is the

room clean?” can provide a very useful approximation to the reward function, and it could eventually

learn that checking for visible dirt is an even cheaper but still-useful approximation. This could allow

it to learn a good cleaning policy using an extremely small number of detailed evaluations.

More broadly, use of semi-supervised RL with a reliable but sparse true approval metric may in-

centivize communication and transparency by the agent, since the agent will want to get as much

cheap proxy feedback as it possibly can about whether its decisions will ultimately be given high

reward. For example, hiding a mess under the rug simply breaks the correspondence between the

user’s reaction and the real reward signal, and so would be avoided.

We can imagine many possible approaches to semi-supervised RL. For example:

• Supervised Reward Learning: Train a model to predict the reward from the state on either

a per-timestep or per-episode basis, and use it to estimate the payoﬀof unlabelled episodes,

with some appropriate weighting or uncertainty estimate to account for lower conﬁdence in

estimated vs known reward.

[37] studies a version of this with direct human feedback as

the reward. Many existing RL approaches already ﬁt estimators that closely resemble reward

predictors (especially policy gradient methods with a strong baseline, see e.g. [134]), suggesting

that this approach may be eminently feasible.

• Semi-supervised or Active Reward Learning: Combine the above with traditional semi-

supervised or active learning, to more quickly learn the reward estimator. For example, the

agent could learn to identify “salient” events in the environment, and request to see the reward

associated with these events.

• Unsupervised Value Iteration: Use the observed transitions of the unlabeled episodes to

make more accurate Bellman updates.

• Unsupervised Model Learning: If using model-based RL, use the observed transitions of

the unlabeled episodes to improve the quality of the model.

As a toy example, a semi-supervised RL agent should be able to learn to play Atari games using

a small number of direct reward signals, relying almost entirely on the visual display of the score.

This simple example can be extended to capture other safety issues: for example, the agent might

have the ability to modify the displayed score without modifying the real score, or the agent may

need to take some special action (such as pausing the game) in order to see its score, or the agent

may need to learn a sequence of increasingly rough-and-ready approximations (for example learning

that certain sounds are associated with positive rewards and other sounds with negative rewards).

Or, even without the visual display of the score, the agent might be able to learn to play from only

a handful of explicit reward requests (“how many points did I get on the frame where that enemy

ship blew up? How about the bigger enemy ship?”)

12

## Page 13

An eﬀective approach to semi-supervised RL might be a strong ﬁrst step towards providing scalable

oversight and mitigating other AI safety problems. It would also likely be useful for reinforcement

learning, independent of its relevance to safety.

There are other possible approaches to scalable oversight:

• Distant supervision. Rather than providing evaluations of some small fraction of a sys-

tem’s decisions, we could provide some useful information about the system’s decisions in the

aggregate or some noisy hints about the correct evaluations There has been some work in

this direction within the area of semi-supervised or weakly supervised learning. For instance,

generalized expectation criteria [94, 45] ask the user to provide population-level statistics (e.g.

telling the system that on average each sentence contains at least one noun); the DeepDive sys-

tem [139] asks users to supply rules that each generate many weak labels; and [65] extrapolates

more general patterns from an initial set of low-recall labeling rules. This general approach is

often referred to as distant supervision, and has also received recent attention in the natural

language processing community (see e.g. [60, 99] as well as several of the references above).

Expanding these lines of work and ﬁnding a way to apply them to the case of agents, where

feedback is more interactive and i.i.d. assumptions may be violated, could provide an approach

to scalable oversight that is complementary to the approach embodied in semi-supervised RL.

• Hierarchical reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning [40] oﬀers an-

other approach to scalable oversight. Here a top-level agent takes a relatively small number of

highly abstract actions that extend over large temporal or spatial scales, and receives rewards

over similarly long timescales. The agent completes actions by delegating them to sub-agents,

which it incentivizes with a synthetic reward signal representing correct completion of the

action, and which themselves delegate to sub-sub-agents. At the lowest level, agents directly

take primitive actions in the environment.

The top-level agent in hierarchical RL may be able to learn from very sparse rewards, since it

does not need to learn how to implement the details of its policy; meanwhile, the sub-agents

will receive a dense reward signal even if the top-level reward is very sparse, since they are

optimizing synthetic reward signals deﬁned by higher-level agents. So a successful approach

to hierarchical RL might naturally facilitate scalable oversight.4

Hierarchical RL seems a particularly promising approach to oversight, especially given the

potential promise of combining ideas from hierarchical RL with neural network function ap-

proximators [84].

Potential Experiments: An extremely simple experiment would be to try semi-supervised RL in

some basic control environments, such as cartpole balance or pendulum swing-up. If the reward is

provided only on a random 10% of episodes, can we still learn nearly as quickly as if it were provided

every episode? In such tasks the reward structure is very simple so success should be quite likely.

A next step would be to try the same on Atari games. Here the active learning case could be quite

interesting—perhaps it is possible to infer the reward structure from just a few carefully requested

samples (for example, frames where enemy ships are blowing up in Space Invaders), and thus learn

to play the games in an almost totally unsupervised fashion. The next step after this might be to

try a task with much more complex reward structure, either simulated or (preferably) real-world. If

learning was suﬃciently data-eﬃcient, then these rewards could be provided directly by a human.

Robot locomotion or industrial control tasks might be a natural candidate for such experiments.

4When implementing hierarchical RL, we may ﬁnd that subagents take actions that don’t serve top-level agent’s

real goals, in the same way that a human may be concerned that the top-level agent’s actions don’t serve the human’s

real goals. This is an intriguing analogy that suggests that there may be fruitful parallels between hierarchical RL

and several aspects of the safety problem.

Safe Exploration

All autonomous learning agents need to sometimes engage in exploration—taking actions that don’t

seem ideal given current information, but which help the agent learn about its environment. However,

exploration can be dangerous, since it involves taking actions whose consequences the agent doesn’t

understand well. In toy environments, like an Atari video game, there’s a limit to how bad these

consequences can be—maybe the agent loses some score, or runs into an enemy and suﬀers some

damage. But the real world can be much less forgiving. Badly chosen actions may destroy the agent

or trap it in states it can’t get out of. Robot helicopters may run into the ground or damage property;

industrial control systems could cause serious issues. Common exploration policies such as epsilon-

greedy [150] or R-max [31] explore by choosing an action at random or viewing unexplored actions

optimistically, and thus make no attempt to avoid these dangerous situations. More sophisticated

exploration strategies that adopt a coherent exploration policy over extended temporal scales [114]

could actually have even greater potential for harm, since a coherently chosen bad policy may be

more insidious than mere random actions. Yet intuitively it seems like it should often be possible

to predict which actions are dangerous and explore in a way that avoids them, even when we don’t

have that much information about the environment. For example, if I want to learn about tigers,

should I buy a tiger, or buy a book about tigers? It takes only a tiny bit of prior knowledge about

tigers to determine which option is safer.

In practice, real world RL projects can often avoid these issues by simply hard-coding an avoidance

of catastrophic behaviors. For instance, an RL-based robot helicopter might be programmed to

override its policy with a hard-coded collision avoidance sequence (such as spinning its propellers to

gain altitude) whenever it’s too close to the ground. This approach works well when there are only

a few things that could go wrong, and the designers know all of them ahead of time. But as agents

become more autonomous and act in more complex domains, it may become harder and harder to

anticipate every possible catastrophic failure. The space of failure modes for an agent running a

power grid or a search-and-rescue operation could be quite large. Hard-coding against every possible

failure is unlikely to be feasible in these cases, so a more principled approach to preventing harmful

exploration seems essential. Even in simple cases like the robot helicopter, a principled approach

would simplify system design and reduce the need for domain-speciﬁc engineering.

There is a sizable literature on such safe exploration—it is arguably the most studied of the problems

we discuss in this document. [55, 118] provide thorough reviews of this literature, so we don’t review

it extensively here, but simply describe some general routes that this research has taken, as well as

suggesting some directions that might have increasing relevance as RL systems expand in scope and

capability.

• Risk-Sensitive Performance Criteria: A body of existing literature considers changing

the optimization criteria from expected total reward to other objectives that are better at

preventing rare, catastrophic events; see [55] for a thorough and up-to-date review of this

literature.

These approaches involve optimizing worst-case performance, or ensuring that

the probability of very bad performance is small, or penalizing the variance in performance.

These methods have not yet been tested with expressive function approximators such as deep

neural networks, but this should be possible in principle for some of the methods, such as

[153], which proposes a modiﬁcation to policy gradient algorithms to optimize a risk-sensitive

criterion. There is also recent work studying how to estimate uncertainty in value functions

that are represented by deep neural networks [114, 53]; these ideas could be incorporated into

risk-sensitive RL algorithms. Another line of work relevant to risk sensitivity uses oﬀ-policy

estimation to perform a policy update that is good with high probability [156].

• Use Demonstrations: Exploration is necessary to ensure that the agent ﬁnds the states that

are necessary for near-optimal performance. We may be able to avoid the need for exploration

14

## Page 15

altogether if we instead use inverse RL or apprenticeship learning, where the learning algorithm

is provided with expert trajectories of near-optimal behavior [128, 2]. Recent progress in inverse

reinforcement learning using deep neural networks to learn the cost function or policy [51]

suggests that it might also be possible to reduce the need for exploration in advanced RL

systems by training on a small set of demonstrations. Such demonstrations could be used to

create a baseline policy, such that even if further learning is necessary, exploration away from

the baseline policy can be limited in magnitude.

• Simulated Exploration: The more we can do our exploration in simulated environments

instead of the real world, the less opportunity there is for catastrophe. It will probably al-

ways be necessary to do some real-world exploration, since many complex situations cannot

be perfectly captured by a simulator, but it might be possible to learn about danger in sim-

ulation and then adopt a more conservative “safe exploration” policy when acting in the real

world. Training RL agents (particularly robots) in simulated environments is already quite

common, so advances in “exploration-focused simulation” could be easily incorporated into

current workﬂows. In systems that involve a continual cycle of learning and deployment, there

may be interesting research problems associated with how to safely incrementally update poli-

cies given simulation-based trajectories that imperfectly represent the consequences of those

policies as well as reliably accurate oﬀ-policy trajectories (e.g. “semi-on-policy” evaluation).

• Bounded Exploration: If we know that a certain portion of state space is safe, and that

even the worst action within it can be recovered from or bounded in harm, we can allow

the agent to run freely within those bounds. For example, a quadcopter suﬃciently far from

the ground might be able to explore safely, since even if something goes wrong there will be

ample time for a human or another policy to rescue it. Better yet, if we have a model, we

can extrapolate forward and ask whether an action will take us outside the safe state space.

Safety can be deﬁned as remaining within an ergodic region of the state space such that

actions are reversible [104, 159], or as limiting the probability of huge negative reward to some

small value [156]. Yet another approaches uses separate safety and performance functions and

attempts to obey constraints on the safety function with high probabilty [22]. As with several

of the other directions, applying or adapting these methods to recently developed advanced RL

systems could be a promising area of research. This idea seems related to H-inﬁnity control [20]

and regional veriﬁcation [148].

• Trusted Policy Oversight: If we have a trusted policy and a model of the environment, we

can limit exploration to actions the trusted policy believes we can recover from. It’s ﬁne to

dive towards the ground, as long as we know we can pull out of the dive in time.

• Human Oversight: Another possibility is to check potentially unsafe actions with a human.

Unfortunately, this problem runs into the scalable oversight problem: the agent may need to

make too many exploratory actions for human oversight to be practical, or may need to make

them too fast for humans to judge them. A key challenge to making this work is having the

agent be a good judge of which exploratory actions are genuinely risky, versus which are safe

actions it can unilaterally take; another challenge is ﬁnding appropriately safe actions to take

while waiting for the oversight.

Potential Experiments: It might be helpful to have a suite of toy environments where unwary

agents can fall prey to harmful exploration, but there is enough pattern to the possible catastro-

phes that clever agents can predict and avoid them. To some extent this feature already exists in

autonomous helicopter competitions and Mars rover simulations [104], but there is always the risk

of catastrophes being idiosyncratic, such that trained agents can overﬁt to them. A truly broad set

of environments, containing conceptually distinct pitfalls that can cause unwary agents to receive

15

## Page 16

extremely negative reward, and covering both physical and abstract catastrophes, might help in the

development of safe exploration techniques for advanced RL systems. Such a suite of environments

might serve a benchmarking role similar to that of the bAbI tasks [163], with the eventual goal being

to develop a single architecture that can learn to avoid catastrophes in all environments in the suite.

Robustness to Distributional Change

All of us occasionally ﬁnd ourselves in situations that our previous experience has not adequately

prepared us to deal with—for instance, ﬂying an airplane, traveling to a country whose culture is

very diﬀerent from ours, or taking care of children for the ﬁrst time. Such situations are inherently

diﬃcult to handle and inevitably lead to some missteps. However, a key (and often rare) skill in

dealing with such situations is to recognize our own ignorance, rather than simply assuming that

the heuristics and intuitions we’ve developed for other situations will carry over perfectly. Machine

learning systems also have this problem—a speech system trained on clean speech will perform very

poorly on noisy speech, yet often be highly conﬁdent in its erroneous classiﬁcations (some of the

authors have personally observed this in training automatic speech recognition systems). In the case

of our cleaning robot, harsh cleaning materials that it has found useful in cleaning factory ﬂoors

could cause a lot of harm if used to clean an oﬃce. Or, an oﬃce might contain pets that the robot,

never having seen before, attempts to wash with soap, leading to predictably bad results. In general,

when the testing distribution diﬀers from the training distribution, machine learning systems may

not only exhibit poor performance, but also wrongly assume that their performance is good.

Such errors can be harmful or oﬀensive—a classiﬁer could give the wrong medical diagnosis with

such high conﬁdence that the data isn’t ﬂagged for human inspection, or a language model could

output oﬀensive text that it conﬁdently believes is non-problematic. For autonomous agents acting

in the world, there may be even greater potential for something bad to happen—for instance, an

autonomous agent might overload a power grid because it incorrectly but conﬁdently perceives that

a particular region doesn’t have enough power, and concludes that more power is urgently needed

and overload is unlikely. More broadly, any agent whose perception or heuristic reasoning processes

are not trained on the correct distribution may badly misunderstand its situation, and thus runs the

risk of committing harmful actions that it does not realize are harmful. Additionally, safety checks

that depend on trained machine learning systems (e.g. “does my visual system believe this route is

clear?”) may fail silently and unpredictably if those systems encounter real-world data that diﬀers

suﬃciently from their training data. Having a better way to detect such failures, and ultimately

having statistical assurances about how often they’ll happen, seems critical to building safe and

predictable systems.

For concreteness, we imagine that a machine learning model is trained on one distribution (call it

p0) but deployed on a potentially diﬀerent test distribution (call it p∗). There are many other ways

to formalize this problem (for instance, in an online learning setting with concept drift [70, 54]) but

we will focus on the above for simplicity. An important point is that we likely have access to a

large amount of labeled data at training time, but little or no labeled data at test time. Our goal

is to ensure that the model “performs reasonably” on p∗, in the sense that (1) it often performs

well on p∗, and (2) it knows when it is performing badly (and ideally can avoid/mitigate the bad

performance by taking conservative actions or soliciting human input).

There are a variety of areas that are potentially relevant to this problem, including change detection

and anomaly detection [21, 80, 91], hypothesis testing [145], transfer learning [138, 124, 125, 25],

and several others [136, 87, 18, 122, 121, 74, 147]. Rather than fully reviewing all of this work in

detail (which would necessitate a paper in itself), we will describe a few illustrative approaches and

lay out some of their relative strengths and challenges.

16

## Page 17

Well-speciﬁed models: covariate shift and marginal likelihood. If we specialize to prediction

tasks and let x denote the input and y denote the output (prediction target), then one possibility

is to make the covariate shift assumption that p0(y|x) = p∗(y|x). In this case, assuming that we

can model p0(x) and p∗(x) well, we can perform importance weighting by re-weighting each training

example (x, y) by p∗(x)/p0(x) [138, 124]. Then the importance-weighted samples allow us to estimate

the performance on p∗, and even re-train a model to perform well on p∗. This approach is limited

by the variance of the importance estimate, which is very large or even inﬁnite unless p0 and p∗are

close together.

An alternative to sample re-weighting involves assuming a well-speciﬁed model family, in which case

there is a single optimal model for predicting under both p0 and p∗. In this case, one need only

heed ﬁnite-sample variance in the estimated model [25, 87]. A limitation to this approach, at least

currently, is that models are often mis-speciﬁed in practice. However, this could potentially be over-

come by employing highly expressive model families such as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces [72],

Turing machines [143, 144], or suﬃciently expressive neural nets [64, 79]. In the latter case, there

has been interesting recent work on using bootstrapping to estimate ﬁnite-sample variation in the

learned parameters of a neural network [114]; it seems worthwhile to better understand whether

this approach can be used to eﬀectively estimate out-of-sample performance in practice, as well as

how local minima, lack of curvature, and other peculiarities relative to the typical setting of the

bootstrap [47] aﬀect the validity of this approach.

All of the approaches so far rely on the covariate shift assumption, which is very strong and is

also untestable; the latter property is particularly problematic from a safety perspective, since it

could lead to silent failures in a machine learning system. Another approach, which does not rely on

covariate shift, builds a generative model of the distribution. Rather than assuming that p(x) changes

while p(y|x) stays the same, we are free to assume other invariants (for instance, that p(y) changes

but p(x|y) stays the same, or that certain conditional independencies are preserved). An advantage

is that such assumptions are typically more testable than the covariate shift assumption (since they

do not only involve the unobserved variable y). A disadvantage is that generative approaches are

even more fragile than discriminative approaches in the presence of model mis-speciﬁcation — for

instance, there is a large empirical literature showing that generative approaches to semi-supervised

learning based on maximizing marginal likelihood can perform very poorly when the model is mis-

speciﬁed [98, 110, 35, 90, 88].

The approaches discussed above all rely relatively strongly on having a well-speciﬁed model family —

one that contains the true distribution or true concept. This can be problematic in many cases, since

nature is often more complicated than our model family is capable of capturing. As noted above,

it may be possible to mitigate this with very expressive models, such as kernels, Turing machines,

or very large neural networks, but even here there is at least some remaining problem: for example,

even if our model family consists of all Turing machines, given any ﬁnite amount of data we can only

actually learn among Turing machines up to a given description length, and if the Turing machine

describing nature exceeds this length, we are back to the mis-speciﬁed regime (alternatively, nature

might not even be describable by a Turing machine).

Partially speciﬁed models: method of moments, unsupervised risk estimation, causal

identiﬁcation, and limited-information maximum likelihood. Another approach is to take

for granted that constructing a fully well-speciﬁed model family is probably infeasible, and to design

methods that perform well despite this fact. This leads to the idea of partially speciﬁed models —

models for which assumptions are made about some aspects of a distribution, but for which we are

agnostic or make limited assumptions about other aspects. For a simple example, consider a variant

of linear regression where we might assume that y = ⟨w∗, x⟩+ v, where E[v|x] = 0, but we don’t

make any further assumptions about the distributional form of the noise v. It turns out that this is

already enough to identify the parameters w∗, and that these parameters will minimize the squared

17

## Page 18

prediction error even if the distribution over x changes. What is interesting about this example is

that w∗can be identiﬁed even with an incomplete (partial) speciﬁcation of the noise distribution.

This insight can be substantially generalized, and is one of the primary motivations for the gen-

eralized method of moments in econometrics [68, 123, 69]. The econometrics literature has in fact

developed a large family of tools for handling partial speciﬁcation, which also includes limited-

information maximum likelihood and instrumental variables [10, 11, 133, 132].

Returning to machine learning, the method of moments has recently seen a great deal of success for

use in the estimation of latent variable models [9]. While the current focus is on using the method of

moments to overcome non-convexity issues, it can also oﬀer a way to perform unsupervised learning

while relying only on conditional independence assumptions, rather than the strong distributional

assumptions underlying maximum likelihood learning [147].

Finally, some recent work in machine learning focuses only on modeling the distribution of errors of

a model, which is suﬃcient for determining whether a model is performing well or poorly. Formally,

the goal is to perform unsupervised risk estimation — given a model and unlabeled data from a

test distribution, estimate the labeled risk of the model. This formalism, introduced by [44], has

the advantage of potentially handling very large changes between train and test — even if the

test distribution looks completely diﬀerent from the training distribution and we have no hope of

outputting accurate predictions, unsupervised risk estimation may still be possible, as in this case we

would only need to output a large estimate for the risk. As in [147], one can approach unsupervised

risk estimation by positing certain conditional independencies in the distribution of errors, and using

this to estimate the error distribution from unlabeled data [39, 170, 121, 74]. Instead of assuming

independence, another assumption is that the errors are Gaussian conditioned on the true output

y, in which case estimating the risk reduces to estimating a Gaussian mixture model [18]. Because

these methods focus only on the model errors and ignore other aspects of the data distribution, they

can also be seen as an instance of partial model speciﬁcation.

Training on multiple distributions. One could also train on multiple training distributions in

the hope that a model which simultaneously works well on many training distributions will also work

well on a novel test distribution. One of the authors has found this to be the case, for instance,

in the context of automated speech recognition systems [7]. One could potentially combine this

with any of the ideas above, and/or take an engineering approach of simply trying to develop design

methodologies that consistently allow one to collect a representative set of training sets and from this

build a model that consistently generalizes to novel distributions. Even for this engineering approach,

it seems important to be able to detect when one is in a situation that was not covered by the training

data and to respond appropriately, and to have methodologies for adequately stress-testing the model

with distributions that are suﬃciently diﬀerent from the set of training distributions.

How to respond when out-of-distribution. The approaches described above focus on detecting

when a model is unlikely to make good predictions on a new distribution. An important related

question is what to do once the detection occurs. One natural approach would be to ask humans for

information, though in the context of complex structured output tasks it may be unclear a priori

what question to ask, and in time-critical situations asking for information may not be an option.

For the former challenge, there has been some recent promising work on pinpointing aspects of a

structure that a model is uncertain about [162, 81], as well as obtaining calibration in structured

output settings [83], but we believe there is much work yet to be done. For the latter challenge, there

is also relevant work based on reachability analysis [93, 100] and robust policy improvement [164],

which provide potential methods for deploying conservative policies in situations of uncertainty; to

our knowledge, this work has not yet been combined with methods for detecting out-of-distribution

failures of a model.

Beyond the structured output setting, for agents that can act in an environment (such as RL agents),

18

## Page 19

information about the reliability of percepts in uncertain situations seems to have great potential

value. In suﬃciently rich environments, these agents may have the option to gather information

that clariﬁes the percept (e.g. if in a noisy environment, move closer to the speaker), engage in low-

stakes experimentation when uncertainty is high (e.g. try a potentially dangerous chemical reaction

in a controlled environment), or seek experiences that are likely to help expose the perception

system to the relevant distribution (e.g. practice listening to accented speech). Humans utilize such

information routinely, but to our knowledge current RL techniques make little eﬀort to do so, perhaps

because popular RL environments are typically not rich enough to require such subtle management

of uncertainty. Properly responding to out-of-distribution information thus seems to the authors

like an exciting and (as far as we are aware) mostly unexplored challenge for next generation RL

systems.

A unifying view: counterfactual reasoning and machine learning with contracts. Some

of the authors have found two viewpoints to be particularly helpful when thinking about problems

related to out-of-distribution prediction. The ﬁrst is counterfactual reasoning [106, 129, 117, 30],

where one asks “what would have happened if the world were diﬀerent in a certain way”?

In

some sense, distributional shift can be thought of as a particular type of counterfactual, and so

understanding counterfactual reasoning is likely to help in making systems robust to distributional

shift.

We are excited by recent work applying counterfactual reasoning techniques to machine

learning problems [30, 120, 151, 160, 77, 137] though there appears to be much work remaining to

be done to scale these to high-dimensional and highly complex settings.

The second perspective is machine learning with contracts — in this perspective, one would like to

construct machine learning systems that satisfy a well-deﬁned contract on their behavior in analogy

with the design of software systems [135, 28, 89]. [135] enumerates a list of ways in which existing

machine learning systems fail to do this, and the problems this can cause for deployment and

maintenance of machine learning systems at scale. The simplest and to our mind most important

failure is the extremely brittle implicit contract in most machine learning systems, namely that they

only necessarily perform well if the training and test distributions are identical. This condition is

diﬃcult to check and rare in practice, and it would be valuable to build systems that perform well

under weaker contracts that are easier to reason about. Partially speciﬁed models oﬀer one approach

to this — rather than requiring the distributions to be identical, we only need them to match on

the pieces of the distribution that are speciﬁed in the model. Reachability analysis [93, 100] and

model repair [58] provide other avenues for obtaining better contracts — in reachability analysis, we

optimize performance subject to the condition that a safe region can always be reached by a known

conservative policy, and in model repair we alter a trained model to ensure that certain desired

safety properties hold.

Summary. There are a variety of approaches to building machine learning systems that robustly

perform well when deployed on novel test distributions.

One family of approaches is based on

assuming a well-speciﬁed model; in this case, the primary obstacles are the diﬃculty of building

well-speciﬁed models in practice, an incomplete picture of how to maintain uncertainty on novel

distributions in the presence of ﬁnite training data, and the diﬃculty of detecting when a model is

mis-speciﬁed. Another family of approaches only assumes a partially speciﬁed model; this approach

is potentially promising, but it currently suﬀers from a lack of development in the context of machine

learning, since most of the historical development has been by the ﬁeld of econometrics; there is also

a question of whether partially speciﬁed models are fundamentally constrained to simple situations

and/or conservative predictions, or whether they can meaningfully scale to the complex situations

demanded by modern machine learning applications. Finally, one could try to train on multiple

training distributions in the hope that a model which simultaneously works well on many training

distributions will also work well on a novel test distribution; for this approach it seems particularly

important to stress-test the learned model with distributions that are substantially diﬀerent from

19

## Page 20

any in the set of training distributions. In addition, it is probably still important to be able to

predict when inputs are too novel to admit good predictions.

Potential Experiments: Speech systems frequently exhibit poor calibration when they go out-of-

distribution, so a speech system that “knows when it is uncertain” could be one possible demon-

stration project. To be speciﬁc, the challenge could be: train a state-of-the-art speech system on a

standard dataset [116] that gives well-calibrated results (if not necessarily good results) on a range

of other test sets, like noisy and accented speech. Current systems not only perform poorly on

these test sets when trained only on small datasets, but are usually overconﬁdent in their incorrect

transcriptions. Fixing this problem without harming performance on the original training set would

be a valuable achievement, and would obviously have practical value. More generally, it would be

valuable to design models that could consistently estimate (bounds on) their performance on novel

test distributions. If a single methodology could consistently accomplish this for a wide variety of

tasks (including not just speech but e.g. sentiment analysis [24], as well as benchmarks in computer

vision [158]), that would inspire conﬁdence in the reliability of that methodology for handling novel

inputs. Note that estimating performance on novel distributions has additional practical value in

allowing us to then potentially adapt the model to that new situation. Finally, it might also be

valuable to create an environment where an RL agent must learn to interpret speech as part of some

larger task, and to explore how to respond appropriately to its own estimates of its transcription

error.

Related Eﬀorts

As mentioned in the introduction, several other communities have thought broadly about the safety

of AI systems, both within and outside of the machine learning community. Work within the machine

learning community on accidents in particular was discussed in detail above, but here we very brieﬂy

highlight a few other communities doing work that is broadly related to the topic of AI safety.

• Cyber-Physical Systems Community: An existing community of researchers studies the

security and safety of systems that interact with the physical world. Illustrative of this work

is an impressive and successful eﬀort to formally verify the entire federal aircraft collision

avoidance system [75, 92]. Similar work includes traﬃc control algorithms [101] and many

other topics. However, to date this work has not focused much on modern machine learning

systems, where formal veriﬁcation is often not feasible.

• Futurist Community: A cross-disciplinary group of academics and non-proﬁts has raised

concern about the long term implications of AI [27, 167], particularly superintelligent AI. The

Future of Humanity Institute has studied this issue particularly as it relates to future AI sys-

tems learning or executing humanity’s preferences [48, 43, 14, 12]. The Machine Intelligence

Research Institute has studied safety issues that may arise in very advanced AI [57, 56, 36, 154,

142], including a few mentioned above (e.g., wireheading, environmental embedding, counter-

factual reasoning), albeit at a more philosophical level. To date, they have not focused much

on applications to modern machine learning. By contrast, our focus is on the empirical study

of practical safety problems in modern machine learning systems, which we believe is likely to

be robustly useful across a broad variety of potential risks, both short- and long-term.

• Other Calls for Work on Safety: There have been other public documents within the

research community pointing out the importance of work on AI safety. A 2015 Open Letter

[8] signed by many members of the research community states the importance of “how to

reap [AI’s] beneﬁts while avoiding the potential pitfalls.” [130] propose research priorities for

20

## Page 21

robust and beneﬁcial artiﬁcial intelligence, and includes several other topics in addition to a

(briefer) discussion of AI-related accidents. [161], writing over 20 years ago, proposes that

the community look for ways to formalize Asimov’s ﬁrst law of robotics (robots must not

harm humans), and focuses mainly on classical planning. Finally, two of the authors of this

paper have written informally about safety in AI systems [146, 34]; these postings provided

inspiration for parts of the present document.

• Related Problems in Safety: A number of researchers in machine learning and other ﬁelds

have begun to think about the social impacts of AI technologies. Aside from work directly on

accidents (which we reviewed in the main document), there is also substantial work on other

topics, many of which are closely related to or overlap with the issue of accidents. A thorough

overview of all of this work is beyond the scope of this document, but we brieﬂy list a few

emerging themes:

• Privacy: How can we ensure privacy when applying machine learning to sensitive data

sources such as medical data? [76, 1]

• Fairness: How can we make sure ML systems don’t discriminate? [3, 168, 6, 46, 119, 169]

• Security: What can a malicious adversary do to a ML system? [149, 96, 97, 115, 108, 19]

• Abuse:5 How do we prevent the misuse of ML systems to attack or harm people? [16]

• Transparency: How can we understand what complicated ML systems are doing? [112,

166, 105, 109]

• Policy: How do we predict and respond to the economic and social consequences of ML?

[32, 52, 15, 33]

We believe that research on these topics has both urgency and great promise, and that fruitful

intersection is likely to exist between these topics and the topics we discuss in this paper.

Conclusion

This paper analyzed the problem of accidents in machine learning systems and particularly rein-

forcement learning agents, where an accident is deﬁned as unintended and harmful behavior that

may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We presented ﬁve possible research problems

related to accident risk and for each we discussed possible approaches that are highly amenable to

concrete experimental work.

With the realistic possibility of machine learning-based systems controlling industrial processes,

health-related systems, and other mission-critical technology, small-scale accidents seem like a very

concrete threat, and are critical to prevent both intrinsically and because such accidents could cause

a justiﬁed loss of trust in automated systems. The risk of larger accidents is more diﬃcult to gauge,

but we believe it is worthwhile and prudent to develop a principled and forward-looking approach to

safety that continues to remain relevant as autonomous systems become more powerful. While many

current-day safety problems can and have been handled with ad hoc ﬁxes or case-by-case rules, we

believe that the increasing trend towards end-to-end, fully autonomous systems points towards the

need for a uniﬁed approach to prevent these systems from causing unintended harm.

5Note that “security” diﬀers from “abuse” in that the former involves attacks against a legitimate ML system

by an adversary (e.g. a criminal tries to fool a face recognition system), while the latter involves attacks by an ML

system controlled by an adversary (e.g. a criminal trains a “smart hacker” system to break into a website).
