## Abstract

Named for orbital kinship with Pluto, the Plutinos are a prominent group of Kuiper Belt objects

whose orbital periods are in libration about the 3/2 ratio with Neptune’s. We investigate the long

term orbital dynamics of known Plutinos, with attention to the additional libration (or lack thereof)

of their argument of perihelion, g, a well-known characteristic of Pluto’s orbit. We show that the g

librators amongst the Plutinos cluster around an arc in the eccentricity–inclination parameter plane.

This previously unreported dynamical structure is owed to a family of periodic orbits of the third

kind in the restricted problem of three bodies, identified by Poincar´e at the end of the 19th century.

Approximately sixteen percent of the currently known Plutinos exhibit g librations, a far greater

fraction than the ratios of the associated libration frequencies. These results may offer new constraints

for theoretical models of the dynamical history of the Plutinos and of the orbital migration history of

the giant planets.

## 1. Introduction

The Plutinos are a dynamical group of Kuiper Belt objects whose orbital period is in 3/2 resonant ratio with

Neptune’s. Their existence and high abundance is amongst the strongest lines of evidence for the orbital migration of

the giant planets during the late stages of planet formation in the ancient Solar system (see, e.g., reviews by Nesvorn´y

2018; Malhotra 2019; Gladman & Volk 2021). The defining characteristic of the Plutinos is the libration of a critical

resonant angle, σ, defined as

σ = 3λ −2λ′ −ϖ,

(1)

where λ denotes mean longitude, ϖ denotes longitude of perihelion, and the primed quantities denote the parameters

of Neptune. The critical resonant angle of every Plutino librates around a center at σ = 180◦, with libration periods

of O(104) years.

Like Pluto itself, some Plutinos exhibit the additional property that their argument of perihelion, g, librates around

one of two centers, either g = +90◦or g = −90◦, with libration periods on the order of O(106) years; we call these

the doubly librating Plutinos. (We denote the argument of perihelion with g, following the traditional notation of the

canonical Delaunay elements of the Keplerian osculating ellipse, although ω is also commonly used in the literature for

this element (e.g. Brouwer & Clemence 1961).) The libration of g is also known as the von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai [vZLK]

oscillation, a phenomenon that has historically been studied in the context of the secular (orbit-averaged) three body

problem (e.g., Ito & Ohtsuka 2019; Tremaine 2023, note that the terms “Kozai resonance” or “Lidov–Kozai resonance”

are also used in the literature). This classical model neglects the effects of mean motion resonances. For the case of

g librations in the presence of a mean motion resonance and in the presence of additional planetary perturbers, the

mathematical analysis of the vZLK phenomenon requires special care in the orbit-averaging procedure (e.g., Saillenfest

2020; Lei et al. 2022; Ito & Malhotra 2023, and references therein).

Malhotra and Ito

In the present work, we examine the dynamics of the Plutinos, with attention to the doubly librating subset. Section

2 describes the observational data of the Plutinos and our methodology for identifying the doubly librating subset.

In Section 3, we describe how the doubly librating Plutinos cluster around a specific structure in the eccentricity–

inclination parameter space, and how this structure is related to a family of periodic orbits in the three body problem

identified long ago by Poincar´e (1892), specifically the “periodic orbits of the third kind”. Section 4 summarizes and

concludes with remarks on the relative abundance of the doubly librating Plutinos and possible implications for their

origins and the nature of giant planet migration.

## 2. Numerical Simulations

We retrieved the list of Plutinos identified and published in Volk & Van Laerhoven (2024). Then, we obtained the

current orbital data of these objects from JPL Horizons System (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/). We

also obtained from the Horizons System at the same time the data for solar system parameters (masses of the Sun and

the eight major planets and the orbital parameters of the planets). We used these data as the inputs for numerical orbit

propagation for a time span of 100 myr, with the SWIFT RMVS3 code (Levison & Duncan 1994). SWIFT RMVS3

is a regularized mixed variable symplectic integrator optimized for fast and accurate propagation of planetary orbits.

The Plutinos were treated as test particles in this numerical simulation. The initial propagation step size was chosen

as 30 days, and we recorded the orbital evolution of planets and test particles every 500 years.

From the time series of the orbit propagation results, we identified 441 long term stable Plutinos, using the criterion

that the range of the critical resonant angle, σ modulo 360◦, over the 100 myr time span remained limited: max{σ} −

min{σ} < 358◦. These identifications were verified by visual inspections of plots of σ(t). The reduction in the number

of surviving Plutinos from the initial sample size of 453 to 441 is due to our longer integration time span (100 myr)

compared to the 10 myr time span used in Volk & Van Laerhoven (2024). Even so, this sample size is significantly

larger than in previous studies of the orbital characteristics of known Plutinos. For comparison, Lawler & Gladman

(2013) and Volk et al. (2016) studied Plutino samples of less than 25, Balaji et al. (2023) worked with a Plutino sample

of 85.

Within this sample of 441 long term stable Plutinos we found 69 cases of g librators, that is a ∼16% fraction. A few

words are in order regarding how we identified the g librators. Recall that g is defined as the angular measure from

the longitude of ascending node to the direction of pericenter of the orbit. The longitude of ascending node depends

upon the choice of reference plane. JPL Horizons adopts the J2000 ecliptic as the reference plane, a practical choice for

observational solar system astronomy. However, on secular timescales, the orbital planes of the planets precess around

the plane normal to the total angular momentum vector of the solar system, the so-called invariable plane (Murray

& Dermott 1999; Souami & Souchay 2012). Considering that the giant planets are the major perturbers defining the

long term dynamics of the Plutinos, we adopted this plane as the reference plane for all angular orbital elements. We

computed all orbital elements relative to the solar system barycenter. We looked for cases in which the time series of a

Plutino’s g showed persistent librations about a possible mean value. Guidance from the classical (non-resonant) vZLK

theory of the circular restricted three body problem (e.g. Ito & Ohtsuka 2019) indicates that there are four possible

centers of g libration: 0, 90◦, 180◦and 270◦. In the 3:2 exterior mean motion resonance, the g libration is expected to

be centered at these same four values, but in other resonances the g librations can be centered at other values (Kozai

1985; Saillenfest et al. 2016; Saillenfest 2020). We looked for g librations about all four centers, with the criterion that

the range of g over the entire 100 myr span remains limited to a half-circle: max{g −gc} −min{g −gc} < 179◦, where

gc takes one of the four values (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees). The angular quantity g(t) −gc (modulo 360◦)) is taken to

be in the range [−180◦, +180◦]. Of the 69 cases of g librators, none were found librating about 0 or 180 degrees. The

g-librators were nearly equally divided between those centered at gc = 90◦(34 objects) and gc = 270◦(35 objects).

From the time series of the orbit propagation results, we calculated the time-averaged values of the eccentricity and

of the inclination of each Plutino over 100 myr. These results are discussed in the next section.

## 3. Results

Our main results are illustrated in three figures (Figs. 1, 2, 3), and are as follows.

Fig. 1 (left) show scatter plots of the osculating orbital elements (semimajor axis, a, eccentricity e, and inclination

i) of the Plutinos at the initial epoch. In the histograms accompanying the scatter plots, it can be observed that

eccentricities below about 0.1 are rare, there is a prominent peak near 0.25, and a cut-off above about 0.35. The

inclinations are concentrated within a few degrees of the invariable plane, but there is a substantial tail of high

inclinations reaching ∼30◦and a few larger values (up to ∼54◦). These features of the Plutino eccentricities and

inclinations have been noted in previous studies, albeit with smaller sample sizes (e.g., Gomes 2003; Li et al. 2014;

Nesvorn´y 2018; Gladman & Volk 2021).

The eccentricity distribution declines sharply above ∼0.35. It is largely sculpted by long term stability, as higher

eccentricity Plutinos are not protected from destabilizing perturbation at close encounters with Uranus when they reach

perihelion. At low eccentricities, the relative population is limited by the relative phase space volumes in Neptune’s

exterior 3:2 mean motion resonance, which has a narrow neck at low eccentricities in the (a, e) plane (e.g., Lan &

Malhotra 2019; Balaji et al. 2023).

The inclination distribution has been the subject of much commentary in the literature, particularly the difficulty

of accounting for the abundance of higher inclinations with theoretical models (e.g., Gladman & Volk 2021). Many

observational surveys for Kuiper belt objects have been concentrated on fields closer to the invariable plane (e.g.,

Bernstein et al. 2004; Petit et al. 2011; Bannister et al. 2016). Consequently, the higher inclination objects are likely

under-represented in the discovered population, underscoring the high abundance of the inclination distribution.

The g librators amongst the Plutinos are highlighted in green as the filled points in the scatter plots in Fig. 1 (left),

and as the green histograms in Fig. 1 (right). It can be observed that the g librators tend to have higher eccentricity

and higher inclination, compared with the overall population of Plutinos.

Fig. 2(a) shows a scatter plot of the osculating eccentricities and inclinations, and Fig. 2(b) shows a scatter plot

of these time-averaged elements. A positive correlation between the osculating eccentricity and inclination of the g

librators is apparent to the eye. In the time-averaged elements this correlation comes into sharper focus as a clustering

along an approximately hyperbolic arc. Some Plutinos that are not g librators also hug the hyperbolic arc in Fig. 2(b).

An examination of the time series of g(t) of these cases reveals that they exhibit intermittent g librations, sometimes

red curve was computed for the circular restricted six body problem [CR6BP] of the Sun, the four giant planets and a (massless)

Plutino whereas the black dot-dash curve was computed for the circular restricted three body problem [CR3BP] of the Sun,

Neptune and a (massless) Plutino. For both models we averaged over the mean longitudes, while taking account of the mean

slipping between librating about a center at g = +90◦and at g = −90◦. This is why they are not identified with our

criterion that demands persistent g librations over the whole 100 myr time span of the numerical simulations.

To place the clustering of the g librators in a physical context, we plot two theoretical curves in Fig. 3, together with

the green points indicating the g librators amongst the observed Plutinos. The red curve is the locus in the (eccentricity–

inclination parameter plane) of the local minima of the disturbing function for Plutinos, in an approximate model of

the circular restricted six body problem [CR6BP] of the Sun, the four giant planets and a (massless) Plutino. For

the purpose of computing this curve in this model, the giant planets’ orbits were fixed as circular and co-planar.

The orbit-averaged disturbing potential (averaged over the mean longitudes), is computed at the nominal center of

the mean motion resonance, i.e., at a/aNeptune = (3/2)

2

3 , while taking account of the constraint σ = 180◦. We use

numerical quadrature to carry out the orbit-averaging, for a wide range of the quantity (1 −e2) cos2 i of a Plutino.

This is a conserved quantity for a test particle in the averaged model of the circular restricted three body problem

and is widely used to characterize the vZLK oscillation, both in the resonant and non-resonant cases (e.g. Kozai 1962;

Morbidelli 2002; Tremaine 2023). This procedure follows established methods in the literature (e.g., see Section 5 in

Saillenfest 2020; Ito & Malhotra 2023, and references therein). From these calculations, we identified the local minima

of the disturbing potential at g = 90◦. These minima are the same for g = −90◦owing to the symmetry of the model

with respect to the common plane of the planets. The black dot-dashed curve is obtained similarly, but with the

circular restricted three body model [CR3BP] of the Sun, Neptune and a Plutino; that is, it neglects Jupiter, Saturn

and Uranus.

Malhotra and Ito

In the well-known idealized model of the CR3BP (two massive primaries on circular orbits and a test particle), the

conditions encapsulated in “σ = 180◦, g = 90◦” can be recognized as the conditions for periodic orbits of the third

kind described in Poincar´e (1892). Periodic orbits are characterized by the property that they retrace their path in

space. In Poincar´e’s classification, periodic orbits of the first kind are those that are familiar today as the five Lagrange

points of the planar circular restricted three body problem; they are fixed points in the rotating frame. The periodic

orbits of the second kind are also found in the planar geometry: rather than fixed points, they trace closed curves in

the rotating frame; they have mean motion in exact integer ratio with the mean motion of the primaries. The periodic

orbits of the third kind trace three-dimensional closed curves in the rotating frame. We can also see that the first

kind represent five cases of the coplanar 1:1 mean motion resonance whereas the second kind represent coplanar mean

motion resonances of all other integer ratios. The third kind encompass mean motion resonances of inclined orbits with

the added constraint of a stationary argument of pericenter. Jefferys & Standish (1966) and Jefferys & Standish (1972)

computed the trace in the eccentricity–inclination plane of such families of periodic orbits of the three-dimensional

circular restricted three body problem, for many mean motion resonant ratios; in particular, the curve labeled “4”

in Figure 10 in Jefferys & Standish (1972) is the trace in the eccentricity–inclination plane of the periodic orbit of

the third kind for the exterior 3:2 mean motion resonance at g = ±90◦. Our independent computation of this curve

is the black dot-dashed curve in our Fig. 3. We observe that the red curve in our Fig. 3 (which is the locus of the

minima of the disturbing function for the Plutinos in the averaged circular restricted six body model) resembles the

black dot-dashed curve, but it is displaced towards lower eccentricities. With numerical experimentation, we verified

that the displacement toward lower eccentricities arises from the orbit-averaged effects of the inner three giant planets,

Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.

In our computations for the red curve, we did not find any local minima of the averaged disturbing function for

inclinations below ∼4.36◦and eccentricities below 0.242. However, we note one exceptional case of a doubly librating

Plutino below these values and distinctly away from the red curve in Fig. 3. This object, 2015 VR164, has time-averaged

inclination and eccentricty of ∼0.22 degrees and ∼0.206, respectively. Because its orbit plane nearly coincides with

the reference (invariable) plane, we suspect that its g libration is not owed to dynamics but to a kinematic effect

related to the reference plane. We leave detailed analysis of this case to a future investigation.

## 4. Summary And Discussion

We summarize our work as follows.

1. We have shown that the g librators amongst the Plutinos cluster along an approximately hyperbolic arc in the

time-averaged eccentricity–inclination plane (Fig. 2b).

2. We identified this structure with a local minimum of the orbit-averaged disturbing function for Plutinos, and

also with a family of periodic orbits of the third kind in the circular restricted six-body problem of the Sun, the

four giant planets and a (massless) Plutino. We showed that these periodic orbits are related to the family of

the same name in the circular restricted three body problem, as classified by Poincar´e (1892, see also Jefferys &

Standish (1972)), but they are shifted to lower eccentricities due to the orbit-averaged effects of the additional

three planets (Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus).

3. We obtained an updated estimate – 16% – for the fraction of g librators amongst the Plutinos.

Previous estimates of the fraction of g librators amongst the observed Plutinos have reported values in the range

8%–33%, based on sample sizes of 6–85 Plutinos (Nesvorn´y et al. 2000; Petit et al. 2011; Volk et al. 2016; Balaji

et al. 2023). Our estimate of a 16% fraction is based on a much larger sample size of 441 Plutinos, and it is generally

consistent with the previous results. Simulations of observational survey biases suggest that the true fraction is likely

20%–40% higher, but is difficult to ascertain for the composite of many surveys that have contributed to the current

catalog of all known Kuiper belt objects in the Minor Planet Center’s catalog (Lawler & Gladman 2013).

The prominent clustering of the doubly librating Plutinos in the time-averaged eccentricity–inclination plane (Fig. 2b)

suggests a local over-density. We ask if this is illusory. To answer this question, we must remember that for the three

spatial degrees of freedom of a Plutino, its phase space is of six dimensions, so we must ask about the relative density

in the full phase space. One can imagine that an approximate measure of the relative density would be obtained by

considering the phase space volume for g librations relative to the phase space volume for σ librations (Eq. 1): if the

doubly librating Plutinos were not over- or under-populated, then their population as a fraction of all Plutinos would

## Page 7

be in the proportion of the phase space volume of the g libration zone within that of the σ libration zone. There is

not a straightforward way of estimating these relative volumes without carrying out a very large number of numerical

experiments and N-body simulations, because the shapes of these volumes are complex and include dynamical chaos

effects (e.g., Wiggins 1990). Such complexity exists even in the simplified models, such as the CR3BP and the CR6BP,

that we employed in computing the two theoretical curves in Fig. 3 for the g libration centers. We proceed to make

a rough estimate as follows. In the reduced one-degree-of-freedom pendulum model for resonances, the phase space

volume of the libration zone is proportional to the frequency of small amplitude librations, hence inversely proportional

to the libration period (Tremaine 2023, section 6.1). We then make the ansatz that the phase space volume for the

g librations as a fraction of the phase space volume for the σ librations is the inverse of the ratio of their respective

libration periods. In our simulations, we found that the libration period of σ is typically ∼20 kyr and the libration

period of g is typically ∼4 myr, similar to those periods for Pluto itself (e.g., Malhotra & Williams 1997). Thus, if the

phase space of the Plutinos were populated randomly and uniformly, one would expect the fraction of g librators to be

approximately 0.005. The observed fraction is larger by a factor ∼30, indicating that the g librators are more abundant

than might be expected from a uniform random distribution within the mean motion resonance. We emphasize that

this estimate of the over-density should be verified more rigorously in a future study.

There are two effects in the dynamics of Plutinos that may have contributed to populating their g libration zone

and producing the clustering in the time-averaged eccentricity–inclination plane.

(i) Long term dynamical stability is favored for the g librators because their perihelion occurs well away from

the invariable plane, thereby reducing perturbations from the giant planets. Consequently, long term chaotic

diffusion out of the mean motion resonance, which affects all Plutinos, may be more effective in reducing the

population of the g circulators relative to the g librators. This effect has been noted in a few previous studies

of the dynamical stability of Plutinos on gigayear timescales (e.g. Kuchner et al. 2002; Tiscareno & Malhotra

2009).

(ii) The ancient period of orbital migration of the giant planets may have favored capture of the g librators during

the later stages when the migration would have slowed, enhancing capture into weaker resonances (those with

longer libration periods). This effect has been noted in numerical simulation studies of giant planet migration

models (e.g., Chiang & Jordan 2002; Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2016; Pike et al. 2017; Balaji et al. 2023).

It is worth mention that additional clusterings may exist in the parameter space of time-averaged elements, such

as the apparent cluster of about 40 Plutinos (g circulators, not librators) centered at e ≈0.18, i ≈6◦in Fig. 2b.

It would be interesting to assess the statistical significance of such clusterings in the future; if real, they may be

indicative of collisional families analogous to those found in the main asteroid belt. Indeed, the primary context in

which time-averaged elements have long been used is in the identification of collisional families of asteroids (e.g., Milani

et al. 2014). We emphasize that in the present work, the cluster around the hyperbolic arc in Fig. 2b is owed not to a

collisional family but to the resonant potential function whose local minima support a family of periodic orbits of the

third kind and the associated g librations.

In addition, mutual gravitational perturbations and collisions with other Kuiper belt objects have undoubtedly also

contributed to the details of the distribution of Plutinos within Neptune’s exterior 3:2 mean motion resonance. Further

studies would help assess the relative importance of these different dynamical effects. Future work could also investigate

whether the g librators and the g circulators have systematic differences in their physical properties (such as their sizes,

shapes and colors), to further constrain their origins. The observed abundance of the doubly librating Plutinos may

offer new constraints on their provenance and dynamical history and on the nature of the orbital migration history of

the giant planets.
