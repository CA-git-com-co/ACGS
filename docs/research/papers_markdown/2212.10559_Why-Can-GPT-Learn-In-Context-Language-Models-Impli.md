Abstract

Large pretrained language models have shown

surprising in-context learning (ICL) ability.

With a few demonstration input-label pairs,

they can predict the label for an unseen input

without parameter updates. Despite the great

success in performance, its working mecha-

nism still remains an open question. In this

paper, we explain language models as meta-

optimizers and understand in-context learning

as implicit ﬁnetuning. Theoretically, we ﬁg-

ure out that Transformer attention has a dual

form of gradient descent. On top of it, we un-

derstand ICL as follows: GPT ﬁrst produces

meta-gradients according to the demonstration

examples, and then these meta-gradients are

applied to the original GPT to build an ICL

model. We comprehensively compare the be-

haviors of in-context learning and explicit ﬁne-

tuning on real tasks to provide empirical evi-

dence that supports our understanding. Exper-

imental results show that in-context learning

behaves similarly to explicit ﬁnetuning from

multiple perspectives.

Inspired by the dual

form between Transformer attention and gradi-

ent descent, we design a momentum-based at-

tention by analogy with gradient descent with

momentum. The improved performance over

vanilla attention further supports our under-

standing from another perspective, and more

importantly, shows the potential to utilize our

understanding for future model design. The

code is available at https://aka.ms/icl.

Introduction

In recent years, large pretrained language models,

especially in Transformer-based architectures (e.g.,

GPT; Brown et al. 2020), have shown strong emer-

gent in-context learning (ICL) ability (Wei et al.,

2022; Dong et al., 2023). Different from ﬁnetuning

which needs additional parameter updates, ICL just

needs several demonstration examples prepended

before the query input, and then the model can pre-

dict labels for unseen inputs. On numerous down-

stream tasks, large GPT models can achieve sur-

prising performance, which even exceeds smaller

models with supervised ﬁnetuning. However, al-

though ICL has achieved great performance, its

working mechanism is still an open question to be

investigated.

In this paper, we explain in-context learning as a

process of meta-optimization and analyze connec-

tions between GPT-based in-context learning and

ﬁnetuning. Concentrating on the attention mod-

ules, we ﬁgure out that the Transformer attention

has a dual form of gradient descent. On top of

it, we propose a novel perspective to explain in-

context learning: (1) a pretrained GPT serves as

a meta-optimizer; (2) it produces meta-gradients

according to the demonstration examples through

forward computation; (3) the meta-gradients are

applied to the original language model through at-

tention to build an ICL model. As illustrated in

Figure 1, in-context learning and explicit ﬁnetun-

ing share a dual view of gradient descent, where

ICL produces meta-gradients through forward com-

putation, while ﬁnetuning computes gradients by

back-propagation. Therefore, it is reasonable to un-

derstand in-context learning as implicit ﬁnetuning.

In order to provide empirical evidence to sup-

port our understanding, we conduct comprehensive

experiments based on real tasks. On six classi-

ﬁcation tasks, we compare the model predictions,

attention outputs, attention weights to query tokens,

and attention weights to training tokens between

in-context learning and ﬁnetuning. Experimental

results validate that the behavior of in-context learn-

ing is similar to explicit ﬁnetuning from multiple

perspectives. These results are strong evidence

to prove the reasonability of our understanding of

in-context learning as implicit ﬁnetuning.

Further, inspired by the dual form between Trans-

former attention and gradient descent, we design

a momentum-based attention, which regards the

attention values as meta-gradients and applies the

momentum mechanism (Polyak, 1964; Sutskever

et al., 2013) to them. Experiments on both lan-

guage modeling and in-context learning show that

our momentum-based attention consistently outper-

forms vanilla attention, which supports our under-

standing of meta-optimization again from another

perspective. We note that beyond this preliminary

attempt, our understanding may have more poten-

tial to enlighten model design, which is worth in-

vestigating in the future.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We ﬁgure out a dual form between Trans-

former attention and gradient descent, and ex-

plain ICL as a process of meta-optimization.

• We analyze connections between in-context

learning and explicit ﬁnetuning and propose

to understand ICL as implicit ﬁnetuning.

• We provide several lines of empirical evidence

to prove that ICL and explicit ﬁnetuning be-

have similarly from multiple perspectives.

• We design a momentum-based attention and

validate its effectiveness, which supports our

understanding of meta-optimization again and

shows the potential of our understanding to

enlighten future model design.

Background

2.1

In-Context Learning with GPT

In this paper, we focus on ICL for classiﬁca-

tion tasks using GPT (Brown et al., 2020).

## A

GPT model is stacked with L identical Trans-

former (Vaswani et al., 2017) decoder layers where

each layer consists of an attention module and a

feed-forward network. For a classiﬁcation task,

given a query input text x and a candidate an-

swer set Y = {y1, y2, . . . , ym}, we need to pre-

dict a label ˆy conditional on n demonstration

examples C = {(x′

1, y′

1), (x′

2, y′

2), . . . , (x′

n, y′

n)},

where (x′

i, y′

i) is an input-label pair different from

the query one. Formally, given a GPT model M,

we ﬁrst compute the probability of each answer yj:

PM(yj | C, x).

(1)

Since the label space is restricted for classiﬁca-

tion, we predict the ﬁnal answer ˆy by selecting

the answer with the highest probability from the

candidate answer set Y :

ˆy = arg max

yj

PM(yj | C, x).

(2)

In practice, we usually use a pre-deﬁned template

to format the demonstrations and prepend them

before the query input. Let T (·) be the function

that formats an example, e.g.:

T (x, y) = Sentence: x. Sentiment: y.

(3)

The contextual model input I is organized like

T (x′

1, y′

1) T (x′

2, y′

2) ... T (x′

n, y′

n) T (x, _). (4)

Feeding this contextual input into M, the probabil-

ity of an answer yj is computed as

lj = M(I) · eyj,

(5)

PM(yj | C, x) = softmax(lj),

(6)

where M(I) denotes the output hidden state at the

last token position; eyj denotes the output word

embedding of yj; and lj is the logit corresponding

to the j-th answer.

Dual Form Between Attention and Linear

Layers Optimized by Gradient Descent

The idea in this paper to explain language models

as meta-optimizers is inspired by Aizerman et al.

(1964); Irie et al. (2022). They present that linear

layers optimized by gradient descent have a dual

form of linear attention. Let W0, ∆W ∈Rdout×din

be the initialized parameter matrix and the update

matrix, respectively, and x ∈Rdin be the input rep-

resentation. A linear layer optimized by gradient

descent can be formulated as

F(x) = (W0 + ∆W) x.

(7)

In the back-propagation algorithm, ∆W is com-

puted by accumulating the outer products of his-

toric input representations x′T

i

∈Rdin and the error

signals ei ∈Rdout of their corresponding outputs:

## ∆W =

## X

i

ei ⊗x′

i,

(8)

where ei is derived from the historic output gradi-

ents by multiplying −γ, the negative learning rate.

Combing Equation (7) and Equation (8), we can

derive the dual form of linear layers optimized by

gradient descent:

F(x) = (W0 + ∆W) x

=W0x + ∆Wx

=W0x +

where LinearAttn(V, K, q) denotes the linear at-

tention operation, in which we regard the historic

output error signals E as values, the historic inputs

X′ as keys, and the current input x as the query.

Understanding In-Context Learning

(ICL) as Implicit Finetuning

We ﬁrst qualitatively analyze the Transformer atten-

tion under a relaxed linear attention form to ﬁgure

out a dual form between it and gradient descent.

Then, we compare in-context learning with explicit

ﬁnetuning to analyze connections between these

two optimization forms. Based on these theoreti-

cal ﬁndings, we propose to understand in-context

learning as implicit ﬁnetuning.

3.1

Understanding Transformer Attention as

Meta-Optimization

Let x ∈Rd be the input representation of a query

token t, and q = WQx ∈Rd′ be the attention

query vector. In the ICL setting, the attention result

of a head is formulated as

FICL(q) = Attn(V, K, q)

=WV [X′; X] softmax

(WK[X′; X])T q

√

d

!

, (10)

where WQ, WK, WV ∈Rd′×d are the projection

matrices for computing the attention queries, keys,

and values, respectively;

√

d denotes the scaling

factor; X denotes the input representations of query

tokens before t; X′ denotes the input representa-

tions of the demonstration tokens; and [X′; X] de-

notes the matrix concatenation. For ease of qualita-

tive analysis, we approximate the standard attention

to relaxed linear attention by removing the softmax

operation and the scaling factor:

FICL(q) ≈WV [X′; X]

##  Wk[X′; X]

T q

= WV X (WKX)T q + WV X′  WKX′T q

= e

FICL(q).

(11)

We deﬁne WZSL = WV X (WKX)T as the ini-

tialized parameters to be updated since WZSLq is

the attention result in the zero-shot learning (ZSL)

setting, where no demonstrations are given. Fol-

lowing the reverse direction of Equation (9), we

derive a dual form of the Transformer attention:

e

FICL(q) = WZSLq + WV X′  WKX′T q

=WZSLq + LinearAttn

 WV X′, WKX′, q

=WZSLq +

 (WV x′

i) ⊗

 WKx′



q

=WZSLq + ∆WICLq

= (WZSL + ∆WICL) q.

(12)

As shown in the above equations, the attention to

the demonstration tokens is equivalent to param-

eter updates ∆WICL that take effect on WZSL. In

addition, by analogy with E in Equation (9), we

regard WV X′ as meta-gradients, which are used to

compute the update matrix ∆WICL.

In summary, we explain in-context learning as a

process of meta-optimization: (1) a pretrained GPT

model serves as a meta-optimizer; (2) it produces

meta-gradients according to the demonstration ex-

amples through forward computation; (3) through

attention, the meta-gradients are applied to the orig-

inal language model to build an ICL model.

3.2

Comparing ICL with Finetuning

Based on the above understanding of in-context

learning, we further compare the meta-optimization

of in-context learning with the explicit optimiza-

tion of ﬁnetuning to analyze connections between

them. Considering that ICL directly takes effect

on only the attention keys and values, we design

a speciﬁc ﬁnetuning setting as the compared base-

line, which also updates only the parameters for the

key and value projection. Also in the relaxed linear

attention form, the attention result of a ﬁnetuned

head is formulated as

e

FFT(q) = (WV + ∆WV )XXT (WK + ∆WK)T q

= (WZSL + ∆WFT) q,

(13)

where ∆WK and ∆WV denote the parameter up-

dates to WK and WV , respectively, which are

acquired by back-propagation from task-speciﬁc

training objectives; and ∆WFT is the updates to

WZSL introduced by ﬁnetuning.

For a more fair comparison with in-context learn-

ing, we further restrict the ﬁnetuning setting as fol-

lows: (1) we specify the training examples as the

demonstration examples for in-context learning;

(2) we train each example for only one step in the

same order as demonstrated for in-context learning;

(3) we format each training example with the same

template used for ICL T (x′

i, y′

i) and use the causal

language modeling objective for ﬁnetuning.

Comparing in-context learning and this ﬁnetun-

ing setting, we ﬁnd that ICL has many properties

in common with ﬁnetuning. We organize these

common properties into the following four aspects.

Both Perform Gradient Descent

Comparing

Equation (12) and Equation (13), we ﬁnd that both

in-context learning and ﬁnetuning introduce up-

dates (∆WICL v.s. ∆WFT) to WZSL, which drive

from implicit and explicit gradient descent, respec-

tively. The main difference is that ICL produces

meta-gradients by forward computation while ﬁne-

tuning acquires real gradients by back-propagation.

Same

Training

Information

The

meta-

gradients of ICL are produced according to

the demonstration examples.

The gradients of

ﬁnetuning are also derived from the same training

examples.

That is to say, in-context learning

and ﬁnetuning share the same source of training

information.

Same Causal Order of Training Examples

In-

context learning and our ﬁnetuning setting share

the same causal order of training examples. ICL

uses decoder-only Transformers so the subsequent

tokens in the demonstrations will not affect the pre-

ceding ones. For our ﬁnetuning setting, we use the

same order of training examples and train only one

epoch, so we can also guarantee that the subsequent

examples have no effect on the preceding ones.

Both Aim at Attention

Compared with zero-

shot learning, the direct effect of in-context learn-

ing and our ﬁnetuning are both restricted to the

computation of attention keys and values. For ICL,

the model parameters are unchanged and it encodes

demonstration information into additional keys and

values to change the attention behavior. For ﬁnetun-

ing, due to our restriction, the training information

can be introduced to only the projection matrices

for attention keys and values as well.

Considering the above common properties be-

tween in-context learning and ﬁnetuning, we show

that it is reasonable to understand in-context learn-

ing as implicit ﬁnetuning. In the rest of this paper,

we compare ICL and explicit ﬁnetuning empirically

from multiple perspectives to provide quantitative

results to support this understanding.

Experiments

4.1

Experimental Settings

We analyze two off-the-shelf pretrained GPT mod-

els with 1.3 billion and 2.7 billion model parame-

ters, respectively, which are released by fairseq1.

In the rest of this paper, we call them GPT 1.3B and

GPT 2.7B for short. All experiments are conducted

on NVIDIA V100 GPUs with 32 GB memory.

For each task, we use the same template to for-

mat examples for zero-shot learning (ZSL), ﬁne-

tuning (FT), and in-context learning (ICL). Details

of the templates used for each task are provided

in Appendix A. The answer prediction processes

for ZSL and ﬁnetuning are the same with ICL as

described in Section 2.1, except that they do not

have demonstration examples.

For in-context learning, we ﬁx the max num-

ber of demonstration examples to 32 and tune the

random seed for each task to ﬁnd a set of demon-

stration examples that achieves the best validation

performance. For explicit ﬁnetuning, we use the

same demonstration examples for in-context learn-

ing as the training examples and use SGD as the

optimizer. For a fair comparison, we ﬁne-tune the

for ﬁnetuning and select the one that achieves the

best validation performance. Details of the search

range and selected value for the random seeds and

learning rates are shown in Appendix B.

4.2

Evaluation Datasets

We compare in-context learning and ﬁnetuning

based on six datasets spanning three sorts of

classiﬁcation tasks. SST2 (Socher et al., 2013),

SST5 (Socher et al., 2013), MR (Pang and

Lee, 2005) and Subj (Pang and Lee, 2004) are

four datasets for sentiment classiﬁcation; AG-

News (Zhang et al., 2015) is a topic classiﬁcation

dataset; and CB (De Marneffe et al., 2019) is used

for natural language inference. Statistics of the

number of validation examples and label types are

summarized in Table 1.

For reference, we present the validation accuracy

in the ZSL, ﬁnetuning, and ICL settings on six

classiﬁcation datasets in Table 1. Compared with

ZSL, ICL and ﬁnetuning both achieve considerable

improvements, which means the optimizations they

make are both helpful to these downstream tasks.

4.3

ICL Covers Most of Correct Predictions

of Finetuning

We compute a recall to ﬁnetuning prediction

(Rec2FTP) to measure ICL can cover how much

behavior of ﬁnetuning from the perspective of the

model prediction. We ﬁrst count NFT>ZSL, the

number of query examples that ﬁnetuning can pre-

dict correctly but ZSL cannot. Then, among these

examples, we count N(FT>ZSL)∧(ICL>ZSL), the num-

ber that ICL can also predict correctly. Finally, we

compute the Rec2FTP score as

## N(Ft>Zsl)∧(Icl>Zsl)

## Nft>Zsl

.

A higher Rec2FTP score suggests that ICL cov-

ers more correct behavior of ﬁnetuning from the

perspective of the model prediction.

We show the Rec2FTP scores for two GPT mod-

els on six datasets in Table 2. As shown in the table,

on average, ICL can correctly predict more than

85% of the examples that ﬁnetuning can correct

from ZSL. These results indicate that from the per-

spective of model prediction, ICL can cover most

of the correct behavior of ﬁnetuning.

4.4

ICL Tends to Change Attention Outputs

in the Same Direction as Finetuning

From the perspective of representation, we com-

pute a similarity of the attention output updates

(SimAOU) to measure the similarity between the

updates that ICL and ﬁnetuning make. For a query

example, let h(l)

X denote the normalized output rep-

layer in setting X. The updates of ICL and ﬁne-

tuning compared with ZSL are h(l)

ICL −h(l)

ZSL and

h(l)

FT −h(l)

ZSL, respectively. We compute the cosine

between these two updates to get SimAOU (∆FT)

at the l-th layer. A higher SimAOU (∆FT) means

ICL is more inclined to update the attention output

in the same direction as ﬁnetuning. For comparison,

we also compute a baseline metric called SimAOU

(Random ∆) that computes the similarity between

ICL updates and randomly generated updates.

We present the SimAOU scores averaged across

examples and layers for two GPT models on six

datasets in Table 3.

From the table, we ﬁnd

that SimAOU (Random ∆) is always around zero,

while SimAOU (∆FT) remains much more positive.

These results indicate that ICL updates are much

more similar to ﬁnetuning updates than to random

updates. From the perspective of representation,

we prove that ICL tends to change the attention

outputs in the same direction as ﬁnetuning.

4.5

ICL Is Inclined to Generate Similar

Attention Weights to Finetuning

From the perspective of attention behavior, we com-

pute a similarity of the attention map (SimAM)

to measure the similarity of the attention map to

query tokens for ICL and ﬁnetuning. For a query

example, let m(l,h)

## X

denote the attention weights be-

fore softmax of the last token at the h-th attention

head in the l-th attention layer in setting X. For ICL,

we omit the attention to the demonstration tokens

and only monitor the attention weights to the query

tokens. First, before ﬁnetuning, we compute the

cosine between m(l,h)

ICL and m(l,h)

ZSL and then average

the similarity across attention heads to get SimAM

(Before Finetuning) at each layer. Similarly, after

ﬁnetuning, we compute the cosine between m(l,h)

## Icl

and m(l,h)

## Ft

to get SimAM (After Finetuning). A

higher SimAM (After Finetuning) over SimAM

(Before Finetuning) indicates that the attention be-

havior of ICL is more similar to a ﬁnetuned model

than a non-ﬁnetuned one.

Table 4 demonstrates the SimAM scores aver-

aged across examples and layers for two GPT mod-

els on six datasets. We observe that compared with

attention weights before ﬁnetuning, ICL is more

inclined to generate similar attention weights to

attention weights after ﬁnetuning. Again, from the

perspective of attention behavior, we prove that

ICL behaves similarly to ﬁnetuning.

4.6

ICL and Finetuning Tend to Pay Similar

Attention to Training Tokens

Since we understand ICL as a process of meta-

optimization, we also compare the attention to

training tokens for ICL and ﬁnetuning with the

Kendall rank correlation coefﬁcient (Kendall,

of the last query token in the l-th attention layer,

which is summed across attention heads. For ﬁne-

tuning, we ﬁrst record all the attention queries

Q′(l,h) ∈Rd′×N of the training tokens, and then

use the inner product between them and the atten-

tion query q(l,h) ∈Rd′ of the last token in the

query example as the ﬁnetuning attention weights

to the training tokens: m(l)

## Ft = P

h Q′(l,h)T q(l,h),

which is also summed across attention heads. The

Kendall coefﬁcient between m(l)

ICL and m(l)

FT is com-

puted as Kendall (ICL, FT) =

Pc−Pd

N(N−1)/2, where

N denotes the number of training tokens, Pc de-

notes the number of concordant pairs, and Pd de-

notes the number of discordant pairs. A higher

Kendall coefﬁcient means that the orders of atten-

tion weights to training tokens of ICL and ﬁnetun-

ing are more similar. For comparison, we also com-

pute the Kendall coefﬁcient between m(l)

ICL and ran-

domly generated attention weights m(l)

Random, which

we call Kendall (ICL, Random).

Table 5 shows the Kendall correlation coefﬁ-

cients averaged across examples and layers for two

GPT models on six datasets. We ﬁnd that Kendall

(ICL, Random) is always near zero, while Kendall

(ICL, FT) always maintains a distinctly positive

value. These results suggest that ICL and ﬁnetun-

ing tend to pay similar attention to training tokens.

Momentum-Based Attention Inspired

by Dual Form of Transformer

Attention

We have ﬁgured out the dual form between Trans-

former attention and gradient descent. As illus-

trated in Figure 2, inspired by this dual view,

we investigate whether we can utilize momen-

tum (Polyak, 1964; Sutskever et al., 2013), a widely

used technique for optimization algorithms, to im-

prove Transformer attention.

where γ is the learning rate and η is a scalar be-

tween 0 and 1. As stated in Section 3.1, the atten-

tion values serve as meta-gradients. By analogy

with gradient descent with momentum, we try to

use Exponential Moving Average (EMA; Hunter

1986) to average the attention values to build the

momentum-based attention:

MoAttn(V, K, qt) = Attn(V, K, qt) + EMA(V )

where vi is the i-th attention value vector. The

momentum of attention value vectors explicitly

strengthens the recency bias of attention, which has

been shown helpful for language modeling (Press

et al., 2022). Therefore, we assume that introducing

momentum into attention will contribute to faster

convergence and better performance.

Experiments on Language Modeling

First, we

evaluate the effect of momentum-based attention

on language modeling. We train two GPT models

with 350M parameters from scratch, where one is

the vanilla Transformer, and another applies mo-

mentum to attention. More training details are pro-

vided in Appendix C. We evaluate the perplexity

of these two models on the training set and three

validation sets with input lengths of 256, 512, and

1024, respectively. The results are shown in Table 6.

On all of the validation sets, applying momentum

to attention introduces a consistent perplexity im-

provement compared with the vanilla Transformer.

Experiments on In-Context Learning

We also

evaluate the in-context learning ability of the above

language models to verify the effectiveness of

momentum-based attention on downstream tasks.

We consider six datasets for sentiment analysis

(SST5 (Socher et al., 2013), IMDB (Maas et al.,

2011), and MR (Pang and Lee, 2005)), natural lan-

guage inference (CB (De Marneffe et al., 2019)),

and multi-choice selection (ARC-E (Clark et al.,

2018) and PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020)). For all of

these datasets, we use up to 32 examples as demon-

strations. As shown in Table 7, compared with

vanilla Transformer, using momentum-based atten-

tion achieves consistently higher accuracy on all of

these datasets.

The performance improvements on both lan-

guage modeling and in-context learning prove our

deduction that introducing momentum will im-

prove Transformer attention. From another perspec-

tive, these results further support our understanding

of Transformer attention as meta-optimization.

Related Work

Recently, some pieces of work have attempted to

understand the inference mechanism of in-context

learning. Xie et al. (2022) explain in-context learn-

ing as implicit Bayesian inference. They state that

in-context learning emerges when language mod-

els can infer the shared latent concept among the

demonstration examples, which is learned during

pretraining. On another aspect, Olsson et al. (2022)

focus on speciﬁc modules in Transformers. They

ﬁnd some induction heads in Transformers that re-

fer to abstract patterns in previous sequences to

help predict the next token. They indicate that

the induction heads drive the ability of in-context

learning. Different from them, we concentrate on

the learning algorithm of ICL and explain it as a

process of meta-optimization.

Some other work also studies the learning algo-

rithm of ICL. As a case study, Garg et al. (2022)

show that Transformers can be trained to in-context

learn a class of linear functions and the perfor-

mance is comparable to the least squares estimator.

Based on linear regression, Akyürek et al. (2022)

prove that they can construct parameters of Trans-

formers to implement gradient-descent-based learn-

ing algorithms. Further, they show that models

trained with an in-context learning objective tend

to match the behavior of models computed by ex-

plicit learning algorithms. Also based on regres-

sion tasks, von Oswald et al. (2022) show that lin-

ear attention-only Transformers with constructed

parameters that implement gradient descent and

models learned by an in-context learning objective

are highly related. Compared with them, we are

the ﬁrst ones to explain in-context learning in real

scenarios. To be speciﬁc, (1) we analyze in-context

learning for off-the-shelf GPT models, instead of

models trained from scratch by an ICL objective;

(2) our experiments are based on real NLP tasks,

instead of toy ones like linear regression.

Conclusion

In this paper, we aim to explain the working mech-

anism of GPT-based ICL. Theoretically, we ﬁgure

## Page 9

out a dual form between Transformer attention and

gradient descent, and propose to understand ICL

as a process of meta-optimization. Further, we

analyze connections between ICL and explicit ﬁne-

tuning and show the reasonability to regard ICL as

implicit ﬁnetuning. Empirically, we comprehen-

sively compare ICL and ﬁnetuning based on six

real NLP tasks. The results prove that ICL behaves

similarly to explicit ﬁnetuning from multiple per-

spectives. Further, inspired by our understanding of

meta-optimization, we design a momentum-based

attention that achieves consistent performance im-

provements over vanilla attention. We believe our

understanding will have more potential to enlighten

ICL applications and model design in the future.

Limitations

Although the ability of in-context learning has been

found for different architectures (e.g., Transformer

and LSTM), we consider only Transformer-based

in-context learning in this paper because Trans-

former is the current mainstream architecture of

NLP. However, as for in-context learning itself, ﬁg-

uring out how it works for other architectures is

also a meaningful problem, which we encourage to

study in the future.

As for the dual form we point out between Trans-

former attention and gradient descent, we consider

a relaxed form of linear attention for qualitative

analysis. Although the experimental results sup-

port our understanding well, the mechanism of stan-

dard Transformer attention without approximation

may be more complex and should be studied more

clearly in the future.

As for empirical experiments, our analysis needs

to record a large number of intermediate results

(e.g., attention output representations, and atten-

tion weights to query tokens and demonstration

tokens) for thousands of validation examples. Con-

sidering the storage space and computational cost

of analysis, we only analyze GPT models with up

to 2.7B parameters and leave larger models such as

GPT 13B for future work. In addition, for the clar-

ity of the problem deﬁnition and the convenience

of experiments, our analysis is based on only clas-

siﬁcation tasks. Although classiﬁcation is a repre-

sentative application of in-context learning, other

tasks like multiple choice and open-ended genera-

tion are not considered in this paper and could be

investigated in the future.

Hyper-Parameters for In-Context

Learning and Finetuning

We perform grid search to ﬁnd the best random seed

for ICL and the best learning rate for ﬁnetuning.

The search range for all the datasets is the same.

For random seeds, we search in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

For learning rates, the search base values are

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and we scale them to 0.1,

0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 times, i.e., we have 9×4 =

36 values to search. As an exception, for GPT 1.3B

ﬁnetuned on SST5, we perform a more ﬁne-grained

search and ﬁnally set its learning rate to 0.00016

since the ﬁnetuned model cannot outperform the

zero-shot learning with the above 36 learning rates.

In Table 9, we present the details of the selected

random seeds and learning rates for two GPT mod-

els on six classiﬁcation datasets.
