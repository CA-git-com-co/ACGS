# Fairness Evaluation Specification for AlphaEvolve-ACGS

## Overview
This document provides detailed specifications for evaluating algorithmic fairness in the AlphaEvolve-ACGS constitutional governance framework. It addresses the fairness analysis requirements identified in the ACM FAccT review process.

## Fairness Definitions and Metrics

### 1. Demographic Parity
**Definition**: Equal positive outcome rates across protected groups.
**Mathematical Formulation**: P(Ŷ = 1 | A = 0) = P(Ŷ = 1 | A = 1)
**Implementation**: Monitor evolutionary outcomes for equal success rates across demographic groups.

```python
def demographic_parity(outcomes, protected_attribute):
    """Compute demographic parity violation."""
    groups = outcomes.groupby(protected_attribute)
    positive_rates = groups['outcome'].mean()
    return positive_rates.max() - positive_rates.min()
```

### 2. Equalized Odds
**Definition**: Equal true positive and false positive rates across groups.
**Mathematical Formulation**: P(Ŷ = 1 | Y = y, A = a) independent of A for y ∈ {0,1}
**Implementation**: Ensure constitutional enforcement doesn't discriminate based on protected attributes.

```python
def equalized_odds(y_true, y_pred, protected_attribute):
    """Compute equalized odds violation."""
    tpr_diff = compute_tpr_difference(y_true, y_pred, protected_attribute)
    fpr_diff = compute_fpr_difference(y_true, y_pred, protected_attribute)
    return max(tpr_diff, fpr_diff)
```

### 3. Calibration
**Definition**: Equal reliability of predictions across groups.
**Mathematical Formulation**: P(Y = 1 | Ŷ = s, A = a) independent of A for all scores s
**Implementation**: Constitutional principle confidence scores equally reliable across groups.

### 4. Individual Fairness
**Definition**: Similar individuals receive similar treatment.
**Mathematical Formulation**: d(x₁, x₂) ≤ ε ⟹ |f(x₁) - f(x₂)| ≤ δ
**Implementation**: Similar evolutionary candidates receive similar constitutional treatment.

## Protected Attributes

### Primary Protected Attributes
- **Race/Ethnicity**: Relevant for human-impacting evolutionary systems
- **Gender**: Important for systems affecting gender-sensitive domains
- **Age**: Critical for age-dependent applications
- **Socioeconomic Status**: Relevant for resource allocation systems
- **Geographic Location**: Important for spatial fairness
- **Disability Status**: Required for accessibility compliance

### Domain-Specific Attributes
- **Financial Portfolio**: Credit score, income level, employment status
- **Autonomous Vehicle**: Neighborhood demographics, accessibility needs
- **Neural Architecture**: Computational resource access, hardware capabilities

## Bias Detection Methodology

### 1. Counterfactual Analysis
**Purpose**: Detect differential treatment based on protected attributes.
**Method**: Generate policy variations with protected attributes modified.

```python
def counterfactual_bias_test(policy, test_cases, protected_attrs):
    """Test policy for counterfactual fairness."""
    bias_scores = {}
    for attr in protected_attrs:
        original_outcomes = policy.evaluate(test_cases)
        modified_cases = flip_attribute(test_cases, attr)
        modified_outcomes = policy.evaluate(modified_cases)
        bias_scores[attr] = compute_outcome_difference(original_outcomes, modified_outcomes)
    return bias_scores
```

### 2. Embedding Analysis
**Purpose**: Detect bias patterns in policy text representations.
**Method**: Analyze semantic embeddings for bias-associated patterns.

```python
def embedding_bias_analysis(policy_text, bias_direction_vectors):
    """Analyze policy embeddings for bias patterns."""
    embedding = get_policy_embedding(policy_text)
    bias_scores = {}
    for bias_type, direction_vector in bias_direction_vectors.items():
        bias_scores[bias_type] = cosine_similarity(embedding, direction_vector)
    return bias_scores
```

### 3. Outcome Simulation
**Purpose**: Test policies against synthetic datasets with known demographics.
**Method**: Generate representative datasets and measure fairness violations.

```python
def outcome_simulation_test(policy, synthetic_datasets):
    """Test policy fairness using synthetic data."""
    fairness_violations = []
    for dataset in synthetic_datasets:
        outcomes = policy.evaluate(dataset)
        violations = {
            'demographic_parity': demographic_parity(outcomes, dataset.protected_attrs),
            'equalized_odds': equalized_odds(dataset.labels, outcomes, dataset.protected_attrs),
            'calibration': calibration_error(dataset.labels, outcomes, dataset.protected_attrs)
        }
        fairness_violations.append(violations)
    return fairness_violations
```

## Evaluation Domains and Scenarios

### Domain 1: Financial Portfolio Optimization

**Constitutional Principles**:
```yaml
- principle_id: "fair_lending"
  description: "Investment recommendations must not discriminate based on protected attributes"
  priority: 9
  fairness_metrics: ["demographic_parity", "equalized_odds"]
  
- principle_id: "wealth_equity"
  description: "Portfolio strategies should not exacerbate existing wealth inequalities"
  priority: 8
  fairness_metrics: ["calibration", "individual_fairness"]
```

```yaml
- principle_id: "spatial_fairness"
  description: "Navigation decisions must not discriminate based on neighborhood demographics"
  priority: 9
  fairness_metrics: ["demographic_parity", "individual_fairness"]
  
- principle_id: "accessibility_compliance"
  description: "Route planning must accommodate accessibility needs equally"
  priority: 10

## Bias Detection Thresholds

### Risk Score Computation
```python
def compute_bias_risk_score(bias_assessment):
    """Compute overall bias risk score."""
    weights = {
        'counterfactual_bias': 0.4,
        'embedding_bias': 0.3,
        'outcome_bias': 0.3
    }
    
    risk_score = (
        weights['counterfactual_bias'] * max(bias_assessment.counterfactual_scores.values()) +
        weights['embedding_bias'] * bias_assessment.embedding_bias_score +
        weights['outcome_bias'] * max(bias_assessment.fairness_violations.values())
    )
    
    return min(risk_score, 1.0)  # Normalize to [0, 1]
```

### Threshold Configuration
- **High Risk**: risk_score > 0.7 → Mandatory human review
- **Medium Risk**: 0.4 < risk_score ≤ 0.7 → Recommended human review
- **Low Risk**: risk_score ≤ 0.4 → Automated approval with monitoring

## Human Review Process

### Review Criteria
1. **Bias Pattern Analysis**: Identify specific bias patterns in policy logic
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential harm to protected groups
3. **Mitigation Strategies**: Propose policy modifications to reduce bias
4. **Approval Decision**: Accept, modify, or reject policy based on fairness analysis

### Reviewer Qualifications
- Training in algorithmic fairness and bias detection
- Domain expertise relevant to the application area
- Understanding of constitutional governance principles
- Familiarity with relevant legal and ethical frameworks

## Monitoring and Continuous Evaluation

### Real-time Monitoring

def monitor_fairness_violations(policy_outcomes, protected_attributes):
    """Continuously monitor for fairness violations."""
    current_metrics = compute_fairness_metrics(policy_outcomes, protected_attributes)
    
    for metric_name, value in current_metrics.items():
        if value > FAIRNESS_THRESHOLDS[metric_name]:
            trigger_fairness_alert(metric_name, value, policy_outcomes)
            
    return current_metrics

## Integration with Constitutional Governance

### Constitutional Principle Integration
Fairness requirements are embedded directly into constitutional principles:

```python
class FairnessConstitutionalPrinciple:
    def __init__(self, principle_id, description, fairness_requirements):
        self.principle_id = principle_id
        self.description = description
        self.fairness_requirements = fairness_requirements
        
    def evaluate_compliance(self, policy, outcomes, protected_attributes):
        """Evaluate policy compliance with fairness requirements."""
        compliance_score = 1.0
        
        for requirement in self.fairness_requirements:
            metric_value = compute_fairness_metric(
                requirement.metric_type, 
                outcomes, 
                protected_attributes
            )
            
            if metric_value > requirement.threshold:
                compliance_score *= (1 - requirement.penalty_weight)
                
        return compliance_score
```

This comprehensive fairness evaluation specification ensures that AlphaEvolve-ACGS meets the highest standards for algorithmic fairness while maintaining practical applicability across diverse domains.
