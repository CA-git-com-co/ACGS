## 1. Understanding the arXiv Endorsement Process

### What is Endorsement?
arXiv requires endorsement for first-time submitters in most subject classes. This is a quality control mechanism where established researchers vouch for new contributors.

### Do You Need Endorsement?
**For cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: YES - Endorsement required for first-time submitters
**For cs.CY (Computers and Society)**: YES - Endorsement required for first-time submitters

### How Endorsement Works
1. **Submit without endorsement first** - arXiv will tell you if you need it
2. **If endorsement required**: arXiv provides a 6-character alphanumeric code (e.g., "H6ZX2L")
3. **Find an endorser**: Contact researchers in your field who have published on arXiv
4. **Provide the code**: Give your endorser the 6-character code
5. **Endorser submits**: They enter your code on arXiv's endorsement page

### Finding Endorsers
**Ideal endorsers for your paper**:
- Researchers in AI governance, Constitutional AI, or Evolutionary Computation
- Authors of papers you cite who are active on arXiv
- Faculty at universities with relevant research groups
- Researchers at AI safety organizations

**Endorsement request template** (see Section 4 below)
