- ‚úÖ **curve25519-dalek**: Acknowledged Solana ecosystem limitation, properly documented and ignored
- ‚úÖ **No unsafe code**: All programs use safe Rust exclusively
- ‚úÖ **Constant-time operations**: Where cryptographically relevant
- ‚úÖ **Zero critical vulnerabilities**: Enterprise-grade security compliance achieved
- ‚úÖ **SLSA-Level 3 provenance**: Comprehensive security scanning and validation

#### Vulnerability Management

```toml
# Security patches applied in blockchain/Cargo.toml
[patch.crates-io]
# RUSTSEC-2022-0093: Fix oracle attack in ed25519-dalek
ed25519-dalek = { git = "https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek", rev = "1042cb60a07cdaacb59ca209716b69f444460f8f" }

# RUSTSEC-2024-0344: Fix timing variability in curve25519-dalek (when possible)
# Note: Limited by Solana SDK v1.18.26 dependency constraints
curve25519-dalek = { git = "https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek", tag = "curve25519-4.1.3" }
```

#### Enterprise Security Compliance

- **Zero-tolerance policy**: `cargo audit --ignore RUSTSEC-2024-0344 --deny warnings`
- **Comprehensive scanning**: Trivy, CodeQL, MSDO, Bandit, Safety
- **Automated remediation**: CI/CD pipeline with security gates
- **Regular audits**: Quarterly internal, annual external security reviews

### Program Security

#### Access Controls

- **Constitution Authority**: Controls constitutional changes and emergency actions
- **Policy Authority**: Manages policy creation and updates
- **Appeal Authority**: Handles appeal review and resolution
- **Upgrade Authority**: Controls program upgrades (can be revoked for immutability)

#### Multi-Signature Requirements

- **Constitutional Changes**: Requires 2-of-3 multi-signature approval
- **Emergency Actions**: Single authority with audit logging
- **Program Upgrades**: Dedicated upgrade authority keys

### Account Security

#### PDA (Program Derived Address) Usage

All program accounts use deterministic PDAs with appropriate seeds:

```rust
// Example PDA derivation
[b"constitution", authority.key().as_ref()]
[b"policy", policy_id.as_bytes()]
[b"appeal", appellant.key().as_ref()]
```

#### Account Validation

- Ownership verification for all account modifications
- Signer validation for authority operations
- Cross-program invocation (CPI) security checks

## üîê Key Management

### Key Generation

Use the provided key management script:

```bash
./scripts/key_management.sh generate-governance
```

### Key Storage

- **Development**: Local filesystem with 600 permissions
- **Production**: Hardware security modules (HSMs) recommended
- **Backup**: Encrypted offline storage in multiple locations

### Authority Rotation

Regular authority key rotation schedule:

- **Program Upgrade Keys**: Every 6 months
- **Governance Keys**: Every 12 months
- **Emergency Keys**: Every 3 months

### Key Revocation

For immutable programs:

```bash
./scripts/key_management.sh revoke-program-authority <program_id> <authority_key>
```

## üß™ Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

#### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# Security enforcement in GitHub Actions
env:
  RUSTFLAGS: '-Dwarnings -Dclippy::all -Dclippy::pedantic'

steps:
  - name: Security audit
    run: cargo audit --deny warnings

  - name: Unsafe code check
    run: grep -r "unsafe" programs/ && exit 1 || echo "‚úÖ No unsafe code"
```

#### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all Anchor programs
- **Integration Tests**: Complete governance workflows
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and error handling
- **Fuzzing**: Input validation and instruction deserialization

### Manual Security Reviews

#### Code Review Process

1. **Peer Review**: All code changes require approval
2. **Security Review**: Critical changes require security team review
3. **External Audit**: Annual third-party security audits

#### Penetration Testing
