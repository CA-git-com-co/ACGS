# ACGS-1 Security Scanning Guide

This guide covers the comprehensive security scanning strategy implemented for the ACGS-1 Constitutional Governance System, including automated vulnerability detection, dependency monitoring, and security policy enforcement.

## Overview

The ACGS-1 security scanning framework provides multi-layered security validation:

- **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Daily monitoring of all dependencies
- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated detection of security anti-patterns
- **Container Security Scanning**: Docker image and configuration validation
- **Infrastructure Security**: Kubernetes and Terraform security policies
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance checking

## Security Scanning Workflows

### 1. Comprehensive Security Scanning

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/security-scanning.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Push to main/master/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Weekly scheduled scan (Monday 3 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch

**Components**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Python, Node.js, Rust)
- Static code analysis (Bandit, Semgrep, custom patterns)
- Container security scanning (Trivy, Docker best practices)
- Infrastructure security scanning (Checkov, tfsec)

### 2. Daily Dependency Monitoring

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/dependency-monitoring.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Daily at 6 AM UTC
- Manual dispatch with configurable alert levels

**Features**:
- Continuous monitoring of all dependency ecosystems
- Automatic issue creation for new vulnerabilities
- Trend analysis and reporting
- Configurable alert thresholds per environment

## Security Policy Enforcement

### Automated Policy Enforcement

The security policy enforcement script (`scripts/security/enforce-security-policies.py`) provides:

- **Dockerfile Security**: USER instructions, tag pinning, COPY vs ADD
- **Environment File Security**: Hardcoded secret detection
- **Docker Compose Security**: Privileged containers, network modes, health checks
- **Kubernetes Security**: Security contexts, privileged pods, root users
- **Dependency Security**: Vulnerability scanning integration

### Usage

```bash
# Run all security checks
python scripts/security/enforce-security-policies.py

# Generate JSON report
python scripts/security/enforce-security-policies.py --output json --output-file security-report.json

# Fail CI on violations
python scripts/security/enforce-security-policies.py --fail-on-violations
```

## Security Configuration

### Centralized Configuration

Security settings are centralized in `config/security/security-config.yml`:

- Vulnerability scanning configuration
- Tool-specific settings
- Severity thresholds per environment
- Compliance requirements
- Monitoring and alerting settings

### Environment-Specific Security

#### Development
- Relaxed security for productivity
- Debug endpoints enabled
- Lower vulnerability thresholds
- Basic monitoring

#### Staging
- Production-like security
- Full monitoring stack
- Medium vulnerability thresholds
- Security testing integration

#### Production
- Maximum security configuration
- Zero-tolerance for critical vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Compliance enforcement

## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated scanning identifies vulnerabilities
2. **Assessment**: Severity and impact evaluation
3. **Prioritization**: Based on CVSS score and exploitability
4. **Remediation**: Update dependencies or apply patches
5. **Verification**: Re-scan to confirm fix
6. **Documentation**: Update security documentation

### Severity Levels and Response Times

- **Critical**: Immediate response (< 4 hours)
- **High**: 24 hours
- **Medium**: 1 week
- **Low**: Next maintenance window

### Vulnerability Tracking

- GitHub Security Advisories integration
- Automated issue creation for new vulnerabilities
- Dependency update tracking
- Security patch management

## Compliance and Reporting

### Compliance Standards

The security scanning framework supports:

- **SOC 2**: Security controls and monitoring
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security
- **FedRAMP**: Federal security requirements

### Security Reporting

#### Automated Reports
- Daily vulnerability monitoring reports
- Weekly comprehensive security scans
- Monthly security posture assessments
- Quarterly compliance reports

#### Report Formats
- JSON for automated processing
- SARIF for GitHub Security integration
- PDF for executive summaries
- Dashboard visualizations

## Integration with CI/CD

### Pull Request Security Checks

All pull requests trigger:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Container security validation
- Security policy enforcement

### Deployment Gates

Security scanning results are integrated into deployment gates:
- Development: Basic security checks
- Staging: Comprehensive security validation
- Production: Zero-tolerance security enforcement

### Security Artifacts

Security scan results are preserved as artifacts:
- SARIF files for GitHub Security tab
- JSON reports for automated processing
- Detailed logs for investigation
- Trend analysis data

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-Time Monitoring

- Continuous dependency monitoring
- Security event detection
- Anomaly detection
- Threat intelligence integration

### Alert Channels

- GitHub Issues for vulnerability tracking
- Slack notifications for immediate alerts
- Email reports for management
- PagerDuty for critical incidents

### Metrics and Dashboards

- Vulnerability discovery trends
- Mean time to remediation
- Security posture scores
- Compliance status tracking

## Best Practices

### Development Security

1. **Secure by Default**: Use secure configurations
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current

### Operational Security

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring
2. **Incident Response**: Prepared response procedures
3. **Regular Assessments**: Periodic security reviews
4. **Security Training**: Team security awareness

### Compliance Security

1. **Documentation**: Maintain security documentation
2. **Audit Trails**: Complete activity logging
3. **Access Controls**: Role-based access management
4. **Data Protection**: Encryption and privacy controls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **False Positives**: Review and whitelist legitimate patterns
2. **Tool Failures**: Check tool versions and configurations
3. **Performance Impact**: Optimize scan frequency and scope
4. **Integration Issues**: Verify API keys and permissions

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Critical Vulnerability**: Immediate patching process
2. **Security Incident**: Incident response activation
3. **Compliance Violation**: Remediation and reporting
4. **Tool Outage**: Fallback scanning procedures

## Future Enhancements
