## 📊 Performance and Cost Optimization

### **Cost Reduction Analysis**
The data flywheel automatically analyzes model performance and identifies cost optimization opportunities:

```python
# Automatic cost reduction analysis
if "1b" in best_model and "70b" in baseline_model:
    cost_reduction_potential = 0.986  # Up to 98.6% cost reduction
elif "3b" in best_model and "70b" in baseline_model:
    cost_reduction_potential = 0.95   # Up to 95% cost reduction
elif "8b" in best_model and "70b" in baseline_model:
    cost_reduction_potential = 0.85   # Up to 85% cost reduction
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitors model response times across services
- **Accuracy Measurement**: Tracks model accuracy for different workload types
- **Constitutional Compliance Scoring**: Measures constitutional compliance rates
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitors compute and memory usage

### **Optimization Recommendations**
```python
# Automatic optimization recommendations
recommendations = [
    "Consider replacing meta/qwen3-32b-groq-instruct with meta/llama-3.2-1b-instruct for 98.6% cost reduction",
    "Validate model outputs maintain constitutional compliance",
    "Monitor for potential security vulnerabilities in smaller models",
    "Ensure fine-tuned models preserve security constraints"
]
```
