## 2. Service-by-Service Migration Playbooks

### 2.1 Migration Order & Strategy

**Migration Sequence**: auth → ac → integrity → fv → gs → pgc → ec

**Rationale**:

1. **Auth Service (8000)**: Foundation for all other services
2. **AC Service (8001)**: Core constitutional compliance engine
3. **Integrity Service (8002)**: Cryptographic validation
4. **FV Service (8003)**: Formal verification support
5. **GS Service (8004)**: Governance synthesis
6. **PGC Service (8005)**: Policy governance (most complex)
7. **EC Service (8006)**: Evolutionary computation (least critical)

### 2.2 Auth Service Migration Playbook
