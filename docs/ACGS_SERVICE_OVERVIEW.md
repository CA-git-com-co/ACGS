For a detailed audit of constitutional compliance, refer to the [Quarterly Audit Report Q3 2025](../tools/audit/quarterly_audit.sh).

### Monitoring and Observability

The ACGS system includes a comprehensive monitoring infrastructure built on Prometheus and Grafana to ensure constitutional compliance, optimal performance, and robust security. Key components include:

- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from all ACGS services, including performance data, compliance validation results, and security-related events.
- **Grafana**: Provides real-time dashboards for visualizing key metrics and monitoring the overall health of the system.
- **Alerting Rules**: Configured to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds for constitutional compliance, performance degradation, and security vulnerabilities.

To access the Grafana dashboard, navigate to `config/monitoring/grafana-constitutional-dashboard.json` and import it into your Grafana instance. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the system's health and compliance status.

For detailed information on configuring and using the monitoring infrastructure, refer to `docs/operations/ACGS_PRODUCTION_OPERATIONS.md`.
