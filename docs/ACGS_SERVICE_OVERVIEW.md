### Infrastructure Components

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Port 5439)
  - Primary database with Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation and security.
  - Configured via [Kubernetes Database YAML](../../infrastructure/kubernetes/database.yaml) and [Docker Compose PostgreSQL](../../docker-compose.postgresql.yml).
- **Cache**: Redis (Port 6389)
  - Used for high-speed caching and session management.
  - Configured via [Kubernetes Redis YAML](../../infrastructure/kubernetes/redis.yaml) and [Docker Compose Redis](../../docker-compose.redis.yml).
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with RBAC
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health checks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation

### Performance Targets

All services maintain the following performance standards, aligned with academic quality standards:

- **Latency**: P99 ≤ 5ms for cached queries
- **Throughput**: ≥ 100 RPS sustained
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ≥ 85%
- **Test Coverage**: ≥ 80%
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% validation

For detailed performance metrics standardization and WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation) algorithm specifications, refer to the [ACGS-2 Academic Paper Enhancement Guide](ACADEMIC_PAPER_ENHANCEMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Related Information

### Authentication Service Details

The Authentication Service (Port 8016) provides core functionality for user authentication, token management, and profile retrieval. It includes endpoints such as `/auth/login` for user login and token issuance, `/auth/refresh` for refreshing access tokens, `/auth/logout` for invalidating tokens, and `/auth/profile` for retrieving user profile data.

For more detailed specifications and implementation guidelines, refer to the [Authentication API Documentation](api/authentication.md).

### Constitutional Compliance Architecture

The constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` is a core identifier for the ACGS platform's constitutional compliance mechanism. It ensures that all processes adhere to predefined rules and standards for security and governance. For further details on the underlying architecture, refer to the [ACGS Code Analysis Engine Architecture](docs/architecture/ACGS_CODE_ANALYSIS_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md).
