## Overview

This report summarizes the comprehensive documentation update process for ACGS-1, reflecting the transition to a blockchain-first architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure Changes

### New Blockchain-Focused Architecture

The project now follows a blockchain-first structure:

**Blockchain** (`blockchain/`)
- **Purpose**: On-chain governance enforcement
- **Description**: Solana/Anchor Programs
- **Subdirectories**: programs, client, tests, scripts, quantumagi-deployment

**Services** (`services/`)
- **Purpose**: Off-chain governance services
- **Description**: Backend Microservices
- **Core**: constitutional-ai, governance-synthesis, policy-governance, formal-verification
- **Platform**: authentication, integrity, workflow
- **Research**: federated-evaluation, research-platform
- **Shared**: libraries, utilities

**Applications** (`applications/`)
- **Purpose**: User interfaces for governance participation
- **Description**: Frontend Applications
- **Subdirectories**: governance-dashboard, constitutional-council, public-consultation, admin-panel

**Integrations** (`integrations/`)
- **Purpose**: Bridges between blockchain and off-chain components
- **Description**: Integration Layer
- **Subdirectories**: quantumagi-bridge, alphaevolve-engine, data-flywheel

**Infrastructure** (`infrastructure/`)
- **Purpose**: Deployment and operational infrastructure
- **Description**: Infrastructure & Operations
- **Subdirectories**: docker, kubernetes, monitoring, load-balancer

## Service Port Mapping Updates

| Port | Service | Location | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| 8000 | Authentication Service | `services/platform/authentication/` | User auth & access control |
| 8001 | Constitutional AI Service | `services/core/constitutional-ai/` | Constitutional principles & compliance |
| 8002 | Integrity Service | `services/platform/integrity/` | Data integrity & audit trails |
| 8003 | Formal Verification Service | `services/core/formal-verification/` | Mathematical policy validation |
| 8004 | Governance Synthesis Service | `services/core/governance-synthesis/` | Policy synthesis & management |
| 8005 | Policy Governance Service | `services/core/policy-governance/` | Real-time policy enforcement (PGC) |
| 8006 | Evolutionary Computation Service | `services/core/evolutionary-computation/` | WINA optimization & oversight |

## Path Updates

The following path mappings have been updated throughout the documentation:

- `services/core/constitutional-ai/ac_service/` → `services/core/constitutional-ai/`
- `services/core/governance-synthesis/gs_service/` → `services/core/governance-synthesis/`
- `services/platform/pgc/pgc_service/` → `services/core/policy-governance/`
- `services/core/formal-verification/fv_service/` → `services/core/formal-verification/`
- `services/core/auth/auth_service/` → `services/platform/authentication/`
- `services/platform/integrity/integrity_service/` → `services/platform/integrity/`
- `services/shared/` → `services/shared/`
- `applications/legacy-applications/governance-dashboard/` → `applications/legacy-applications/governance-dashboard/`
- `blockchain/` → `blockchain/`
- `integrations/alphaevolve-engine/` → `integrations/alphaevolve-engine/`

## New Technology Integrations

**Solana Blockchain** (v1.18.22+)
- **Purpose**: On-chain governance enforcement
- **Location**: `blockchain/`

**Anchor Framework** (v0.29.0+)
- **Purpose**: Smart contract development
- **Location**: `blockchain/programs/`

**Quantumagi Core** (vProduction)
- **Purpose**: Constitutional governance on-chain
- **Location**: `blockchain/programs/blockchain/`

**NVIDIA Data Flywheel** (vLatest)
- **Purpose**: AI model optimization
- **Location**: `integrations/data-flywheel/`

**AlphaEvolve Engine** (vLatest)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced governance synthesis
- **Location**: `integrations/alphaevolve-engine/`

## Security Updates

- Zero critical vulnerabilities via cargo audit --deny warnings
- Enterprise-grade testing standards with >80% coverage
- Formal verification compliance per ACGS-1 governance specialist protocol v2.0
- Multi-signature governance for constitutional changes
- Hardware security modules for cryptographic key protection
- Automated secret scanning with 4-tool validation
- SARIF integration for security findings
- Custom ACGS rules for constitutional governance patterns

## Files Requiring Manual Review

**infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml** (Priority: Medium)
- Service build contexts may need updating

**.github/workflows/*.yml** (Priority: High)
- CI/CD paths may need updating

**requirements.txt** (Priority: Low)
- Dependencies may need version updates

**blockchain/Anchor.toml** (Priority: Medium)
- Program configurations should be verified

**service_registry_config.json** (Priority: High)
- Service registry may need port updates

## Validation Steps

1. Run documentation validation script
2. Verify all service README files are updated
3. Check API documentation completeness
4. Validate deployment guide accuracy
5. Test service startup with new paths
6. Verify blockchain program compilation
7. Check frontend application builds
8. Validate integration tests pass
9. Confirm monitoring and logging work
10. Test end-to-end governance workflows

## Next Steps

1. Complete documentation validation
2. Update CI/CD pipeline configurations
3. Test all service integrations
4. Validate blockchain deployment scripts
5. Update monitoring configurations
6. Review and update Docker configurations
7. Test production deployment procedures
8. Validate security configurations
9. Update team onboarding materials
10. Schedule team training on new structure
