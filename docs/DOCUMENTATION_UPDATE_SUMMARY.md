  ACGS-1/
  ├── blockchain/          # Solana/Anchor programs
  ├── services/           # Backend microservices
  ├── applications/       # Frontend applications
  ├── integrations/       # Integration layer
  ├── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure configs
  └── tools/             # Development tools
  ```

## Files That Need Manual Review

### 1. **Legacy Documentation Files**
The following files may contain outdated references and should be reviewed:
- `docs/architecture_documentation.md` - May have old paths
- `docs/deployment_guide.md` - Contains old deployment instructions
- `docs/developer_guide.md` - Contains old development workflows
- Individual service README files in `services/core/` - Need to be moved/updated

### 2. **Configuration Files**
- Docker Compose files may need service name updates
- Kubernetes manifests may need service and port updates
- Environment variable documentation may need updates

### 3. **Script Documentation**
- Script files may contain hardcoded old paths
- README files in `scripts/` directories may need updates

## Validation Steps

### 1. **Link Validation**
All internal documentation links have been updated, but should be validated:
```bash
# Check for broken internal links
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\.\./\|\./" {} \;
```

### 2. **Path Validation**
Verify all referenced paths exist in the new structure:
```bash
# Validate referenced paths
./scripts/validation/validate_documentation_paths.py
```

### 3. **Service URL Validation**
Verify all service URLs and ports are correct:
```bash
# Test all documented service endpoints
./scripts/validation/test_service_endpoints.py
```

## Next Steps

### 1. **Remove Legacy Documentation**
- Archive or remove old documentation files that are no longer relevant
- Update any remaining references to old structure

### 2. **Update Remaining Files**
- Review and update any missed documentation files
- Update inline code comments with new paths
- Update configuration file documentation

### 3. **Create Missing Documentation**
- Individual service README files for new structure
- Integration-specific documentation
- Troubleshooting guides for new structure

### 4. **Validation and Testing**
- Test all documented procedures
- Validate all links and references
- Ensure all examples work with new structure

## Summary
