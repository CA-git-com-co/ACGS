- **Availability**: >99.5% uptime for all core services
- **Cost Efficiency**: <0.01 SOL per governance transaction
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, >80% test coverage

### Blockchain-First Architecture
- Prioritize on-chain functionality and security
- Ensure proper Solana/Anchor best practices with PDA derivations
- Validate integration between blockchain and off-chain components
- Maintain Quantumagi deployment compatibility

## 🚀 Review Process Overview

### Phase 1: Automated Validation (Must Pass)
```
CI/CD Pipeline → Security Scanning → Performance Benchmarks → Quality Gates
```

### Phase 2: Manual Review
```
Architecture → Code Quality → Security → Performance → Constitutional Compliance
```

### Phase 3: Service-Specific Review
```
Service Owner → Domain Expert → Stakeholder Approval
```

### Phase 4: Final Approval
```
Feedback Resolution → Re-validation → Sign-off → Merge
```
