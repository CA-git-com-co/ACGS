## 🔧 **Technical Specification Improvements**

### 4. **State Management Protocol**
**Before**: Vague "state tracking" requirement
**After**: JSON schema for comprehensive state management

```json
{
  "coordination_state": {
    "current_sprintlet": "sprintlet_id",
    "performance_metrics": {
      "p99_latency_ms": 0.0,
      "constitutional_compliance": 1.0
    }
  },
  "assumptions": [...],
  "quality_gates": [...]
}
```

**Before**: Basic quality gates mention
**After**: Comprehensive QA framework with code examples

- Input validation functions
- Process verification checkpoints
- Output validation criteria
- Automated testing integration

**Rationale**: Provides actionable guidance for implementing quality controls rather than just mentioning their importance.

### 6. **Error Recovery & Resilience**
**Before**: Generic "graceful degradation" mention
**After**: Detailed failure mode analysis with specific recovery strategies

```yaml
failure_modes:
  service_unavailable:
    detection: "Health check timeout >30s"
    fallback: "Route to backup service instance"
    recovery: "Exponential backoff retry with circuit breaker"
```

**Rationale**: Provides specific, actionable guidance for handling real-world failure scenarios in production environments.
