## üîç Review Process

### 1. Automated Checks
- CI/CD pipeline passes
- All tests pass
- Code quality checks pass
- Security scans pass
- Performance benchmarks meet targets

### 2. Manual Review Areas

#### Architecture Compliance
- Does the change fit the blockchain-first architecture?
- Are service boundaries respected?
- Is the separation of concerns maintained?

#### Code Quality
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Are naming conventions followed?
- Is the code properly documented?
- Are there any code smells or anti-patterns?

#### Security Review
- Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- Is input validation comprehensive?
- Are authentication/authorization checks proper?
- Is sensitive data handled correctly?

#### Performance Review
- Will this change impact performance?
- Are database queries optimized?
- Is caching used appropriately?
- Are there any potential bottlenecks?

### 3. Constitutional Governance Review
- Does the change maintain constitutional principles?
- Is transparency preserved?
- Are governance workflows respected?
- Is accountability maintained?

## üéØ Service-Specific Guidelines

- No critical security issues
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation completeness
- Code complexity within limits

### Governance Compliance
- Constitutional principle adherence
- Transparency requirements met
- Accountability mechanisms preserved
- Democratic participation enabled

## ü§ù Review Etiquette

### For Reviewers
- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices
- Focus on code, not the person
- Be timely in providing reviews

### For Authors
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Be open to suggestions
- Provide context for design decisions
- Update documentation as needed

## üîÑ Review Workflow

1. **Author submits PR** with clear description
2. **Automated checks** run (CI/CD, tests, security)
3. **Reviewer assignment** based on expertise
4. **Initial review** focusing on architecture and approach
5. **Detailed review** of implementation details
6. **Feedback incorporation** by author
7. **Final approval** when all criteria met
8. **Merge** with appropriate merge strategy
