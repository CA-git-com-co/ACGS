## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. DeepSeek R1 Pilot Manager (`services/shared/deepseek_r1_pilot.py`)

**Core Features:**
- **A/B Testing**: Consistent hash-based traffic routing (10% DeepSeek R1, 90% control)
- **Constitutional Validation**: Real-time compliance checking with confidence scoring
- **Cost Optimization**: 96.4% reduction from $15.00/1M to $0.55/1M tokens
- **Automatic Fallback**: Performance-based fallback to control models
- **DGM Safety Patterns**: Sandbox execution, human review, emergency shutdown

**Key Methods:**
```python
# A/B testing decision
should_use_deepseek_r1(request_id: str) -> bool

# Process request with pilot logic
process_request(request: Dict, request_id: str) -> Dict

# Get performance summary
get_pilot_summary() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### 2. AI Model Service Integration (`services/shared/ai_model_service.py`)

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Pilot-Enabled Generation**: `generate_with_pilot()` method
- **Seamless Integration**: Drop-in replacement for existing `generate()` calls
- **Metadata Tracking**: Constitutional hash, cost optimization flags
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback on pilot failures

**Usage Example:**
```python
ai_service = AIModelService()
response = await ai_service.generate_with_pilot(
    "Constitutional AI compliance validation test",
    request_id="unique_request_id"
)
```

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring (`services/shared/deepseek_r1_monitoring.py`)

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time P95/P99, constitutional compliance rate
- **Cost Analysis**: Real-time savings calculation and ROI tracking
- **Alert System**: 4-tier priority system (Critical/High/Moderate/Low)
- **Dashboard Data**: Comprehensive metrics for visualization
- **Trend Analysis**: Performance improvement/degradation detection

**Alert Thresholds:**
- **Critical**: Compliance <75%, Response time >5s
