### üîí Security Posture Improvement

**Before Integration:**
- 0% input validation coverage
- Vulnerable to all 8 attack patterns
- No automated security testing
- Manual security reviews only

**After Integration:**
- 100% input validation coverage
- Protected against all 8 attack patterns
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Real-time threat detection and blocking
