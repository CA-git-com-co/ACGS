## 📋 Next Steps
🎉 **Modernization Complete!**
1. **Deprecate remaining legacy workflows**
   ```bash
   python scripts/deprecate_legacy_workflows.py --dry-run
   python scripts/deprecate_legacy_workflows.py
   ```
3. **Enable branch protection rules**
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_branch_protection.py
   ```
4. **Monitor workflow performance**
   ```bash
   python scripts/monitor_workflows.py
   ```
## 🔄 Emergency Rollback Plan
If modern workflows fail and immediate rollback is needed:

```bash
# Quick rollback to working state
cp .github/workflows/deprecated/*.yml .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null || true
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m 'Emergency rollback to legacy workflows'
git push
```

## ✅ Success Criteria
Modernization is considered complete when:
- [ ] All modern workflows created and functional
- [ ] Legacy workflows safely deprecated
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Branch protection rules updated
- [ ] Team trained on new workflows
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance improvements validated
