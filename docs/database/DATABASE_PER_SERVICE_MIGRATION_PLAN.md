# ACGS-1 Database Per Service Migration Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Status:** Migration Strategy Complete  
**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Medium

## üéØ Migration Objectives

### Core Principles

1. **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Business continuity maintained
2. **Data Integrity**: 100% data consistency guaranteed
3. **Gradual Transition**: Phased approach with rollback capability
4. **Performance Improvement**: 3-5x throughput increase expected
5. **Service Isolation**: Complete database independence per service

### Expected Benefits

- **Performance**: 3-5x database throughput improvement
- **Availability**: 99.5% ‚Üí 99.9% uptime improvement
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling per service
- **Fault Isolation**: Database failures contained to single service
- **Development Velocity**: Independent schema evolution

## üîÑ Data Synchronization Strategy

### Dual-Write Implementation

```python
class DualWriteManager:
    """Manages dual-write during migration."""

    async def write_data(self, service: str, operation: str, data: dict):
        """Write to both old and new databases."""
        try:
            # Write to new database first
            new_result = await self.write_to_new_db(service, operation, data)

            # Write to old database for consistency
            old_result = await self.write_to_old_db(service, operation, data)

            # Validate consistency
            await self.validate_consistency(service, new_result, old_result)

            return new_result

        except Exception as e:
            # Rollback and alert
            await self.handle_dual_write_failure(service, operation, data, e)
            raise
```

### Data Consistency Validation

```python
class ConsistencyValidator:
    """Validates data consistency between databases."""

    async def validate_service_data(self, service: str) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate data consistency for a service."""
        old_data = await self.fetch_old_db_data(service)
        new_data = await self.fetch_new_db_data(service)

        return self.compare_datasets(old_data, new_data)

    def compare_datasets(self, old_data: dict, new_data: dict) -> ValidationResult:
        """Compare datasets for consistency."""
        # Row count comparison
        # Data hash comparison
        # Foreign key integrity
        # Timestamp consistency
        pass
```

## üö® Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Data Loss Risk**: During migration process
2. **Service Downtime**: During traffic switching
3. **Data Inconsistency**: Between old and new databases
4. **Performance Degradation**: Initial performance issues
5. **Cross-Service Dependencies**: Breaking service integrations

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Data Protection

```bash
# Automated backup before migration
./scripts/pre_migration_backup.sh

# Continuous data validation
./scripts/validate_data_consistency.sh

# Automated rollback triggers
./scripts/auto_rollback_monitor.sh
```

#### Service Availability

```yaml
# Blue-green deployment configuration
traffic_management:
  blue_environment: 'shared_database'
  green_environment: 'service_databases'

  traffic_split:
    initial: 'blue: 100%, green: 0%'
    phase_1: 'blue: 90%, green: 10%'
    phase_2: 'blue: 50%, green: 50%'
    final: 'blue: 0%, green: 100%'

  rollback_triggers:
    error_rate: '>3%'
    response_time: '>1000ms'
    data_consistency: '<99.9%'
```

#### Performance Monitoring

```yaml
# Critical performance metrics
performance_thresholds:
  database_response_time: '50ms (P95)'
  connection_pool_utilization: '<80%'
  replication_lag: '<1 second'
  query_success_rate: '>99.5%'

# Automated alerts
alerts:
  - metric: 'database_response_time'
    threshold: '>100ms'
    action: 'page_on_call_engineer'

  - metric: 'replication_lag'
    threshold: '>5 seconds'
    action: 'escalate_to_dba_team'
