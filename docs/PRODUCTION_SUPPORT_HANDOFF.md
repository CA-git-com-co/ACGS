## 🔧 Production Support Procedures

### **Daily Operations Checklist**

#### Morning Health Check (9:00 AM)

```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
cd /home/ubuntu/ACGS
python3 scripts/acgs_monitoring_dashboard.py

# Verify constitutional compliance
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/v1/constitutional/validate | jq '.constitutional_hash'
# Expected: "cdd01ef066bc6cf2"

# Check system health score
python3 scripts/production_readiness_validation.py
# Expected: 100% score
```

#### Performance Monitoring (Every 4 hours)

```bash
# Run load test to validate performance
python3 scripts/load_test_acgs_pgp.py --concurrent 15

# Check response times
for port in 8000 8001 8002 8003 8004 8005 8006; do
  echo "Port $port: $(curl -s -w "%{time_total}s" http://localhost:$port/health -o /dev/null)"
done
```

#### Security Monitoring (Daily)

```bash
# Run security audit
pnpm audit --json

# Check for constitutional violations
grep -r "constitutional_hash" /home/ubuntu/ACGS/logs/ | grep -v "cdd01ef066bc6cf2"
```

### **Weekly Maintenance Tasks**

#### System Optimization Review (Mondays)

- Review performance metrics and resource utilization
- Check for any degradation in response times
- Validate constitutional compliance trends
- Review security scan results

#### Backup Verification (Wednesdays)

- Verify database backups are current
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Validate configuration backup integrity

#### Documentation Updates (Fridays)

- Update operational logs
- Review and update emergency procedures
- Validate monitoring dashboard accuracy

## 🚨 Emergency Response Procedures

### **Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)**

#### Constitutional Compliance Violation

```bash
# Immediate isolation
./scripts/emergency_shutdown_test.sh

# Verify constitutional hash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/v1/constitutional/validate

# Restore from backup if needed
./scripts/start_all_services.sh
```

#### Service Outage

```bash
# Check service status
./scripts/comprehensive_health_check.sh

# Restart failed services
./scripts/start_all_services.sh

# Validate recovery
python3 scripts/production_readiness_validation.py
```

#### Performance Degradation

```bash
# Check resource usage
top -p $(pgrep -f "acgs")

# Run performance optimization
python3 scripts/system_performance_optimization.py

# Validate improvements
python3 scripts/load_test_acgs_pgp.py --concurrent 20
```
