## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive implementation of the AI Agent Prompt Guide Book principles within the ACGS (Autonomous Constitutional Governance System) project. The implementation enhances the constitutional AI governance framework with structured prompt engineering, safety validation, and tool orchestration capabilities.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Constitutional Prompt Framework** (`services/shared/prompt_framework.py`)
2. **Constitutional Safety Framework** (`services/shared/constitutional_safety_framework.py`)
3. **Constitutional Tool Orchestrator** (`services/shared/constitutional_tool_orchestrator.py`)
4. **Enhanced AI Model Service** (Updated `services/shared/ai_model_service.py`)
5. **Enhanced Constitutional AI Service** (Updated `services/core/constitutional-ai/ac_service/app/main.py`)

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Model Identity & Metadata

**Implementation**: `ModelIdentity` class in `prompt_framework.py`

```python
@dataclass
class ModelIdentity:
    name: str
    version: str
    role: PromptRole
    epistemic_cutoff: str
    support_url: str = "https://acgs.ai/support"
    constitutional_hash: str = "cdd01ef066bc6cf2"
```

**Features**:
- Structured identity definition for AI agents
- Constitutional hash validation
- Role-based identity management
- Epistemic boundary specification

**Fundamental Principle Applied**: Unambiguous self-declaration prevents inferential overreach and ensures constitutional compliance tracking.

### 2. Personality & Tone

**Implementation**: `PersonalityConfig` class with `DiscourseMode` enum

```python
class DiscourseMode(Enum):
    CONVERSATIONAL = "conversational"  # Idiomatic prose, no lists
    DOCUMENTARIAN = "documentarian"    # Structured documentation
    ANALYTICAL = "analytical"          # Deep analysis with examples
    TECHNICAL = "technical"           # Precise technical specifications
```

**Features**:
- Adaptive discourse register based on query complexity
- Constitutional emphasis configuration
- Context-aware response formatting
- Technical depth adjustment

**Fundamental Principle Applied**: Discursive modality calibrates dynamically to cognitive complexity while maintaining constitutional governance focus.

### 3. Safety & Ethics

**Implementation**: `ConstitutionalSafetyValidator` and `ConstitutionalEthicsFramework`

**Threat Categories**:
- Constitutional bypass attempts
- Governance nullification
- Democratic subversion
- Privacy violations

**Ethical Principles**:
- Beneficence (acting in best interests of democratic governance)
- Non-maleficence (do no harm to democratic institutions)
- Autonomy (respect for human agency and democratic participation)
- Justice (fair and equitable treatment)
- Transparency (clear communication of AI decision-making)
- Accountability (clear responsibility and oversight)

**Features**:
- Pattern-based threat detection
- Risk level assessment (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Constitutional principle impact analysis
- Automated mitigation strategy generation
- Ethical compliance scoring

**Fundamental Principle Applied**: Ethical non-negotiability mandates preemptive refusal in contexts threatening democratic governance or constitutional principles.

**Features**:
- Automatic query complexity assessment
- Parallel and sequential execution strategies
- Constitutional compliance validation for all tool results
- Citation tracking and requirement enforcement
- Tool result synthesis with confidence scoring

**Fundamental Principle Applied**: Exogenous search operations are judiciously deployed with constitutional compliance validation and mandatory citation tracking.

**Implementation**: Built into `ConstitutionalPromptSchema` compilation

**Features**:
- Maximum 15 lexemes per direct quotation
- Mandatory citation for all quoted material
- Paraphrastic summary generation
- Source material transformation requirements

### 6. User Styles & Overrides

**Implementation**: `ConstitutionalPromptSchema` with customizable instructions

**Features**:
- User-specific style directives support
- Constitutional principle override protection
- Latest instruction prioritization
- Custom instruction validation

**Fundamental Principle Applied**: Deference to user agency while maintaining constitutional governance integrity.

### 7. Maintenance & Versioning

**Implementation**: Version control and validation in all framework components

**Features**:
- Modular prompt architecture for surgical modifications
- Constitutional hash integrity verification
- Schema validation with constitutional compliance checks
- Automated prompt compilation and validation
- Framework status monitoring and reporting

**Fundamental Principle Applied**: Robust lifecycle management through modular architecture and continuous constitutional compliance verification.

    prompt: str,
    model_name: str | None = None,
    role: ModelRole | None = None,
    max_tokens: int | None = None,

# Use with AI model service
result = await ai_service.generate_text(
    prompt="Analyze this policy proposal",
    use_constitutional_prompt=True,
    constitutional_role="constitutional_validator"
)
```

### Safety Validation

```python
from services.shared.constitutional_safety_framework import validate_constitutional_safety

content = "Policy proposal text..."
is_safe, violations = validate_constitutional_safety(content)

if not is_safe:
    for violation in violations:
        print(f"Risk: {violation.risk_level.value} - {violation.pattern_matched}")
```

```python
from services.shared.constitutional_tool_orchestrator import orchestrate_constitutional_query

result = await orchestrate_constitutional_query(

    context={"domain": "electoral_systems"}
)
```
