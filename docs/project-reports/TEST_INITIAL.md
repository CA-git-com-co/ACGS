# Test Feature: Redis Cache Performance Optimizer

## Overview
Implement a Redis cache performance optimizer that monitors cache hit rates and automatically adjusts cache configurations to maintain optimal performance for ACGS services.

## Requirements
- Monitor cache hit rates across all ACGS services
- Automatically adjust cache TTL and memory allocation
- Maintain constitutional compliance hash validation
- Achieve sub-2ms cache optimization decisions
- Integrate with existing Blackboard Service for coordination

## Performance Targets
- Cache hit rate: >95%
- Optimization latency: <2ms P99
- Memory efficiency: >85%
- Constitutional compliance: 100%

## Integration Points
- Constitutional AI Service (8001): Validate cache optimization decisions
- Blackboard Service (8010): Coordinate cache updates across services
- Integrity Service (8002): Audit cache optimization events
- Multi-Agent Coordinator (8008): Coordinate with other optimization agents
