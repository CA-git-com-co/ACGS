```python
class SecretsManager:
    def get_jwt_secret(self) -> str:
        secret = self.get_secret("JWT_SECRET_KEY")
        if not secret:
            logger.warning("JWT_SECRET_KEY not set, using default (INSECURE)")
        return secret
```

**Impact**:
- Eliminated hardcoded JWT secrets from 5 services
- Environment-based secret management
- Secure fallback mechanisms with warnings

### 2. Constitutional AI Service Refactoring
**Before**: 1,790 lines in single file
**After**: Modular architecture with 62-line main file

**New Structure**:
```
services/core/constitutional-ai/ac_service/app/
├── main.py                    # 62 lines (was 1,790)
├── api/endpoints.py           # REST API endpoints
├── validation/core.py         # Core validation logic
├── compliance/calculator.py   # Compliance scoring
└── config/app_config.py       # Application configuration
```

**Impact**:
- 96.5% code reduction in main file
- Improved maintainability and testing
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Docker Compose Consolidation
**Before**: 48+ scattered docker-compose files
**After**: 6 core files + specialized stacks

**New Structure**:
```
# Core Infrastructure
docker-compose.base.yml              # PostgreSQL, Redis, OPA, NATS
docker-compose.services.yml          # Core ACGS services
docker-compose.monitoring.yml        # Unified monitoring stack

# Environment Overrides
docker-compose.development.override.yml   # Development with hot reload
docker-compose.production.override.yml    # Production optimizations
docker-compose.testing.override.yml       # Testing configurations

# Specialized Stacks
compose-stacks/docker-compose.mcp.yml     # Model Context Protocol services
```

**Impact**:
- 87.5% reduction in docker-compose files (48+ → 6)
- Clear separation by environment and purpose
- Automated migration tools provided

### 4. Service Registry Pattern
**Location**: `services/shared/service_registry.py`

```python
class ACGSServiceRegistry:
    async def register_service(self, service_name: str, instance_id: str, ...):
        # Dynamic service registration with constitutional compliance

    async def discover_services(self, service_name: Optional[str] = None):
        # Service discovery with health checks
```

**Features**:
- Dynamic service discovery
- Health monitoring with heartbeats
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Constitutional compliance validation
- Integration with API Gateway

### 5. Cache Performance Optimizer
**Location**: `tools/acgs_cache_performance_optimizer.py`

```python
class OptimizedCacheManager:
    # Multi-tier caching (L1 memory + L2 Redis)
    # Target: 85% hit rate, <2ms latency
    # Constitutional compliance validation
```

**Performance Targets**:
- 85% cache hit rate (deployed successfully to 5 services)
- <2ms cache operation latency
- Multi-tier caching strategy
- Constitutional hash validation
