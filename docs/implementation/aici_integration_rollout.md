# AICI Integration Rollout Strategy for ACGS-PGP

## Overview

This document outlines the phased rollout strategy for integrating AICI token-level control with ACGS-PGP's constitutional governance system. The rollout is designed to minimize disruption while maximizing the benefits of token-level constitutional enforcement.

## Phase 1: Pilot Implementation (1-2 months)

### Goals

- Validate AICI integration with ACGS-PGP architecture
- Measure performance impact on token generation
- Establish baseline metrics for constitutional compliance

### Implementation Steps

1. **Week 1-2**: Set up AICI development environment
   - Install AICI runtime dependencies
   - Configure WebAssembly sandbox
   - Implement basic constitutional controller
2. **Week 3-4**: Integrate with AC Service (port 8001)
   - Implement token-level constraints
   - Configure OPA policy integration
   - Develop monitoring and metrics
3. **Week 5-6**: Testing and validation
   - Conduct performance testing
   - Validate constitutional compliance
   - Document findings and recommendations

### Success Criteria

- AICI controller successfully enforces constitutional constraints
- Performance overhead <15% on token generation
- Constitutional compliance score >0.95

## Phase 2: Policy Development (2-3 months)

### Goals

- Develop comprehensive token-level constitutional policies
- Optimize policy evaluation performance
- Extend integration to additional services

### Implementation Steps

1. **Week 1-4**: Policy development
   - Translate constitutional principles to token-level constraints
   - Develop OPA policies for AICI integration
   - Implement policy testing framework
2. **Week 5-8**: Performance optimization
   - Implement policy caching
   - Optimize policy evaluation
   - Reduce latency to <5ms per token
3. **Week 9-12**: Extended integration
   - Integrate with GS Service (port 8004)
   - Implement token-level audit logging
   - Develop rollback mechanisms

## Conclusion

The integration of AICI with ACGS-PGP represents a significant advancement in our constitutional governance capabilities. By implementing token-level control with WebAssembly-based sandboxing, we can achieve proactive constitutional enforcement while maintaining our existing security architecture.

### Key benefits include:

- Proactive prevention of constitutional violations
- Granular control over token generation
- Enhanced audit capabilities with token-level logging
- Improved performance through optimized policy evaluation

The phased implementation approach ensures minimal disruption while maximizing the benefits of this integration. With careful attention to performance optimization and comprehensive testing, we can achieve our goal of real-time constitutional governance with minimal overhead.
