## Testing and Validation

### Build Verification ✅
- AC Service Docker build completed successfully (24.3s)
- LangGraph dependencies installed without conflicts
- No import errors or dependency issues

### Next Testing Steps
1. **Service Health Validation**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up langgraph_redis postgres_db
   docker-compose up ac_service
   curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/workflows/capabilities
   ```

2. **Workflow Initialization Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test Constitutional Council workflow creation
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/workflows/initialize \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"workflow_type": "constitutional_council", "initial_data": {...}}'
   ```

3. **Multi-Model Manager Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test GS Service multi-model capabilities
   # (Requires API key configuration)
