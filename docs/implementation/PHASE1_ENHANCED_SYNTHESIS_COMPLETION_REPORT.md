- ✅ Enhanced risk strategies with constitutional awareness
- ✅ Constitutional hash validation (cdd01ef066bc6cf2)
- ✅ Performance optimization targeting >95% accuracy

### 2. Enhanced Data Structures
**Components Implemented**:
- `ConstitutionalPrincipleDecomposition`: Chain-of-thought analysis results
- `DomainOntologySchema`: Structured ontology (id, description, scope, severity, invariant)
- `ValidationPipelineResult`: Comprehensive 4-stage validation results
- `EnhancedSynthesisRequest`: Enhanced request format with constitutional context

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Constitutional Analysis
**Capabilities**:
- Automatic identification of relevant constitutional principles
- Principle decomposition into actionable elements
- Scope analysis (safety-critical, governance-wide, fairness-sensitive)
- Severity assessment (critical, high, medium, low)
- Invariant extraction for constitutional compliance
- Reasoning chain generation for transparency

### 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Features**:
- Constitutional corpus with principles, historical decisions, ontologies
- Context augmentation from constitutional analysis
- Quality scoring for RAG effectiveness
- Consistent constitutional hash validation

### 5. 4-Stage Validation Pipeline
**Stages Implemented**:
1. **LLM Generation Validation**: Quality and completeness checking
2. **Static Validation**: Constitutional compliance verification
3. **Semantic Verification**: Consistency with constitutional principles
4. **SMT Consistency**: Formal verification with fallback mechanisms

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Integration Pattern
```python
Enhanced Request → Chain-of-Thought → RAG Context → Risk Strategy → Validation → Result
      ↓               ↓                ↓             ↓              ↓          ↓
Constitutional   Principle        Constitutional  Enhanced      4-Stage    Combined
  Context       Decomposition       Corpus       Synthesis    Validation   Results
```

### Performance Characteristics
| Risk Strategy | Response Time | Confidence | Constitutional Alignment |

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Synthesis
```python
from policy_synthesis_engine import PolicySynthesisEngine, EnhancedSynthesisRequest, RiskStrategy

# Initialize engine
engine = PolicySynthesisEngine()
await engine.initialize()

# Create enhanced request
request = EnhancedSynthesisRequest(
    title="Safety Protocol Policy",
    description="Enhanced safety protocol for governance operations",
    constitutional_principles=["CP-001", "CP-002"],
    domain_context={"scope": "safety", "priority": "high"},
    risk_strategy=RiskStrategy.ENHANCED_VALIDATION,
    enable_chain_of_thought=True,
    enable_rag=True,
    target_accuracy=0.95
)

# Perform synthesis
result = await engine.synthesize_policy(request, RiskStrategy.ENHANCED_VALIDATION)

# Validate results
assert result["success"] == True
assert result["constitutional_hash"] == "cdd01ef066bc6cf2"
assert result["accuracy_score"] >= 0.95
```

### Multi-Model Consensus
```python
# High-risk policy requiring consensus
request = EnhancedSynthesisRequest(
    title="Constitutional Amendment Policy",
    description="Policy for constitutional governance changes",
    constitutional_principles=["CP-001", "CP-002", "CP-003"],
    domain_context={"scope": "constitutional", "priority": "critical"},
    risk_strategy=RiskStrategy.MULTI_MODEL_CONSENSUS,
    enable_chain_of_thought=True,
    enable_rag=True,
    target_accuracy=0.99
)

result = await engine.synthesize_policy(request, RiskStrategy.MULTI_MODEL_CONSENSUS)

# Validate consensus results
assert result["confidence_score"] >= 0.97
assert result["constitutional_alignment_score"] >= 0.98
assert len(result["validation_pipeline"]["failed_stages"]) == 0
