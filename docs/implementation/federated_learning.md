# Federated Learning Framework in ACGS

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Federated Learning framework implemented within the ACGS project. Federated Learning is a crucial component of ACGS, enabling privacy-preserving machine learning model evaluation and training across distributed data sources.

## 1. Purpose and Benefits of Federated Learning in ACGS

Federated Learning (FL) in the ACGS system addresses the critical need for collaborative machine learning while strictly adhering to data privacy and security principles. The analysis report highlighted the absence of comprehensive documentation for these advanced features, despite their full implementation, underscoring the importance of this guide.

**Purpose**:
The primary purpose of FL in ACGS is to allow multiple clients (e.g., individual users, organizations) to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without directly sharing their raw data. Instead of centralizing data, only model updates (e.g., gradients, model weights) are exchanged.

**Benefits**:

- **Privacy Preservation**: Raw data never leaves the client's device, significantly reducing privacy risks and complying with stringent data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary model updates are transmitted, minimizing the amount of sensitive information exposed during the training process.
- **Collaborative Model Training**: Enables the development of robust and generalized models by leveraging diverse datasets from multiple sources, which might otherwise be inaccessible due to privacy concerns or data silos.
- **Reduced Communication Overhead**: In some FL architectures, only aggregated model updates are sent to the server, potentially reducing network bandwidth compared to transmitting raw data.
- **Edge Intelligence**: Facilitates training on edge devices, bringing AI capabilities closer to the data source and enabling real-time insights.

## 2. Architecture of the Federated Evaluation Framework

The federated evaluation framework in ACGS operates on a client-server architecture, orchestrating collaborative model training across distributed clients.

```

**Client-Side**:
Each client in the federated learning ecosystem holds its own local dataset. During a training round, clients perform the following steps:

1.  **Receive Global Model**: Clients download the current global model from the Federated Learning Server.
2.  **Local Training**: Each client trains this global model on its private local dataset. This involves performing several epochs of training using standard machine learning optimization techniques.
3.  **Generate Local Model Update**: Instead of sending their raw data, clients compute and generate a local model update (e.g., gradients, weight differences) based on their local training.

**Server-Side (Aggregator)**:
The Federated Learning Server, also known as the Aggregator, is responsible for coordinating the entire federated learning process. Its key roles include:

1.  **Initialize and Distribute Global Model**: At the start of the process, or at the beginning of each round, the server initializes and distributes the current global model to selected clients.
2.  **Receive Local Model Updates**: The server collects local model updates from participating clients.
3.  **Aggregate Updates**: Using secure aggregation protocols (detailed below), the server combines the received local model updates to produce a new, improved global model. This aggregation process is designed to prevent the server from inspecting individual client contributions.
4.  **Global Model Update**: The aggregated model becomes the new global model for the next training round.

**Data Flow**:
The data flow within the federated evaluation framework is iterative and privacy-centric:

1.  The server sends the current global model to a subset of selected clients.
2.  Each client trains the model locally on its private data and computes a model update.
3.  Clients send their local model updates (not raw data) back to the server.
4.  The server aggregates these updates using secure protocols to create a new global model.
5.  Steps 1-4 are repeated for a predefined number of training rounds until the global model converges or a performance target is met.

## 3. Cross-Platform Coordination Mechanisms

Effective coordination is vital for the seamless operation of the federated learning framework across diverse client platforms and network conditions.

**Communication Protocols**:
The ACGS federated learning framework primarily utilizes robust and secure communication protocols for client-server interactions:

- **gRPC**: Used for efficient, high-performance communication, especially for transmitting model parameters and updates. gRPC's use of HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers ensures low latency and structured data exchange.
- **Secure WebSocket (WSS)**: Employed for real-time control messages, client registration, and dynamic adjustments during training rounds. WSS provides persistent, full-duplex communication over a secure TLS connection.

**Synchronization**:
Training rounds are carefully synchronized to ensure all participating clients are working with the same global model version and contribute to the same aggregation step:

- **Round-Based Synchronization**: The server initiates and concludes each training round. Clients are expected to complete their local training and submit updates within a specified timeframe.
- **Heartbeat and Acknowledgment**: Clients send periodic heartbeats to the server, and the server acknowledges receipt of model updates, ensuring robust communication and identifying unresponsive clients.

**Client Management**:
The framework includes mechanisms for managing the dynamic nature of client participation:

- **Client Registration**: New clients can register with the federated learning server, providing necessary metadata for participation.
- **Client Selection**: In each round, the server selects a subset of available clients to participate, based on criteria such as availability, data quality, and computational resources. This helps manage scalability and efficiency.
- **Handling Dropouts and Failures**: The system is designed to be resilient to client dropouts or failures. If a client fails to submit an update within the allotted time, its contribution is typically excluded from the current aggregation, and the round proceeds with the remaining clients.

## 4. Secure Aggregation Protocols

To uphold the core principle of privacy preservation, the ACGS federated learning framework incorporates advanced secure aggregation protocols. These protocols ensure that individual client model updates cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal sensitive raw data, even by the aggregating server.

**Importance of Privacy**:
The primary goal of secure aggregation is to prevent the server from learning anything about individual client contributions beyond what is necessary for the global model update. This is crucial for protecting user privacy and maintaining data confidentiality.

**Implemented Protocols**:
The ACGS system leverages a combination of privacy-enhancing technologies:

- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC)**: Specifically, techniques like additive secret sharing are used. Clients encrypt their model updates and send shares to the server and other designated parties. The server can only compute the sum of these encrypted updates without decrypting individual contributions. This ensures that the server only sees the aggregated sum, not individual model parameters.
- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: Noise is strategically added to the model updates (either locally by clients or by the server during aggregation) to obscure individual data points. This provides a mathematical guarantee that the presence or absence of any single data record in the training set does not significantly affect the final model, thus protecting individual privacy. The level of noise can be adjusted to balance privacy guarantees with model utility.
- **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)** (if applicable): If the system requires computations on encrypted data, partially or fully homomorphic encryption schemes might be employed. This allows the server to perform operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) directly on encrypted model updates without decrypting them, further enhancing privacy. (Note: The specific HE scheme and its application depend on the exact computational requirements and performance considerations.)

**How they work**:
These protocols work in concert to create a robust privacy-preserving environment:

- **SMC for Summation**: Clients transform their local model updates into a form that can be securely summed by the server without revealing individual values. For instance, each client splits its update into multiple "shares" and sends different shares to different servers or designated aggregators. Only when all shares are combined can the sum be reconstructed, but no single entity can reconstruct an individual client's update.
- **DP for Noise Injection**: Before sending their updates, clients add a calculated amount of random noise to their model parameters. This noise is calibrated to provide a strong privacy guarantee while minimizing the impact on model accuracy. The aggregation process then averages out this noise across many clients, allowing the true signal to emerge in the global model.

**Threat Model**:
These secure aggregation protocols are designed to mitigate various threats, including:

- **Malicious Server**: Prevents a curious or malicious server from inferring individual client data from their model updates.
- **Colluding Clients**: Protects against a subset of clients colluding with the server to reconstruct other clients' data.
- **Inference Attacks**: Makes it significantly harder for attackers to perform membership inference or property inference attacks on the global model.

## Conclusion

The Federated Learning framework within ACGS represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving machine learning. By decentralizing data and implementing robust secure aggregation protocols, ACGS ensures that sensitive information remains protected while still enabling the development of powerful, collaboratively trained AI models. This comprehensive documentation serves as a foundational resource for understanding the architecture, coordination mechanisms, and security measures that underpin ACGS's commitment to responsible AI development.
