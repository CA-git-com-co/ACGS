## 🔧 Alert Manager Configuration

### Critical Alert Routing
```yaml
# Critical alerts - immediate escalation
- match:
    severity: critical
  receiver: 'critical-response-team'
  group_wait: 5s
  group_interval: 2m
  repeat_interval: 5m
  routes:
    - match:
        component: constitutional_governance
      receiver: 'constitutional-emergency'
    - match:
        component: security
      receiver: 'security-emergency'
```

### Notification Channels
1. **Email**: Immediate delivery to on-call team
2. **SMS**: Critical alerts only, 24/7 delivery
3. **Phone**: Automated call cascade for P0 incidents
4. **Slack**: Real-time team coordination (#acgs-incidents)
5. **PagerDuty**: Escalation management and tracking

## 📋 Incident Response Procedures

### P0 Critical Incident Response (Constitutional Governance Failure)
```bash
# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-2 minutes)
1. Acknowledge alert in PagerDuty
2. Join incident bridge: https://meet.acgs.ai/emergency
3. Execute immediate containment:
   ./scripts/emergency/isolate-affected-services.sh
   ./scripts/emergency/enable-circuit-breakers.sh

# ASSESSMENT (2-5 minutes)  
4. Run system health check:
   ./scripts/comprehensive_health_check.sh
5. Check constitutional governance status:
   curl http://localhost:8005/api/v1/constitutional/state
6. Verify backup systems:
   ./scripts/verify-backup-systems.sh

# COMMUNICATION (5-10 minutes)
7. Update status page: https://status.acgs.ai
8. Notify stakeholders via emergency broadcast
9. Document incident in #acgs-incidents channel
```

### P1 High Priority Response (Service Degradation)
```bash
# RESPONSE ACTIONS (0-5 minutes)
1. Acknowledge alert and assess scope
2. Check service health:
   bash scripts/validate_service_health.sh
3. Review recent deployments:
   git log --oneline -10
4. Check resource utilization:
   ./scripts/monitoring/check-resource-usage.sh

# MITIGATION (5-15 minutes)
5. Apply immediate fixes if known issue
6. Scale services if resource constrained:
   ./scripts/scale-services.sh --service=affected_service --replicas=3
7. Enable degraded mode if necessary:
   ./scripts/enable-degraded-mode.sh
```
