## Incident Response Automation

### Automated Response Triggers

```yaml
incident_response:
  constitutional_hash: "cdd01ef066bc6cf2"
  
  automated_triggers:
    service_unavailable:
      condition: "health_check_failures >= 3"
      actions:
        - restart_service
        - failover_to_backup
        - notify_oncall
      timeout: 300
    
    high_latency:
      condition: "p99_latency > 5ms for 2 minutes"
      actions:
        - scale_up_instances
        - enable_circuit_breaker
        - alert_performance_team
      timeout: 180
    
    constitutional_violation:
      condition: "constitutional_hash_mismatch"
      actions:
        - block_requests
        - emergency_rollback
        - escalate_to_security
      timeout: 60
    
    cache_degradation:
      condition: "cache_hit_rate < 85% for 5 minutes"
      actions:
        - restart_redis
        - warm_cache
        - notify_infrastructure

- **Policy Integrity:** No changes that compromise constitutional policies
- **Audit Trail:** All changes logged with constitutional compliance status
- **Rollback Capability:** All changes must be reversible within RTO targets

### Disaster Recovery Playbooks

#### Database Failover Procedure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# PostgreSQL Failover Procedure
# Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2

echo "üö® Initiating database failover..."

# 1. Validate constitutional compliance
validate_constitutional_hash() {
    if ! grep -r "cdd01ef066bc6cf2" /etc/acgs/config; then
        echo "‚ùå Constitutional compliance validation failed"
        exit 1
    fi
}

# 2. Promote standby to primary
promote_standby() {
    pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
    echo "‚úÖ Standby promoted to primary"
}

# 3. Update application configuration
update_app_config() {
    sed -i 's/primary-db:5439/standby-db:5439/g' /etc/acgs/database.conf
    systemctl reload acgs-services
    echo "‚úÖ Application configuration updated"
}

# 4. Verify service health
verify_health() {
    for service in auth constitutional-ai policy-governance; do
        curl -f http://localhost:800${service#*-}/health || exit 1
    done
    echo "‚úÖ All services healthy"
}

# Execute failover
validate_constitutional_hash
promote_standby
update_app_config
verify_health

echo "üéâ Database failover completed successfully"
```
