config = QwenModelConfig(
    model_name="qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b",
    temperature=0.2,           # Low temperature for consistent reasoning
    top_p=0.7,                # Nucleus sampling parameter
    max_tokens=8192,          # Maximum response length
    enable_reasoning=True,     # Enable reasoning capabilities
    timeout_seconds=60,       # Extended timeout for complex reasoning
    max_retries=3             # Retry attempts for reliability
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Constitutional Analysis

```python
from gs_service.app.core.nvidia_qwen_client import get_nvidia_qwen_client

# Get client instance
client = get_nvidia_qwen_client()

# Perform constitutional analysis
response = await client.generate_constitutional_analysis(
    prompt="Analyze the constitutional implications of AI-powered surveillance systems",
    enable_reasoning=True
)

if response.success:
    print("Analysis:", response.content)
    if response.reasoning_content:
        print("Reasoning:", response.reasoning_content)
```

### Policy Synthesis

```python
# Synthesize policies with constitutional grounding
response = await client.generate_policy_synthesis(
    constitutional_context="Core principles: privacy, fairness, transparency",
    synthesis_requirements="Create policies for AI hiring systems"
)

print("Synthesized Policies:", response.content)
```

### Compliance Analysis

```python
# Analyze policy compliance
response = await client.analyze_constitutional_compliance(
    policy_text="All user data must be encrypted and require consent",
    constitutional_principles=["Privacy", "Transparency", "User autonomy"]
)

# Response includes structured JSON with compliance scores
```

### Conflict Resolution

```python
# Resolve conflicts between policies
conflicting_policies = [
    "Maximize system efficiency through automated decisions",
    "Require human oversight for all critical decisions"
]

response = await client.generate_conflict_resolution(
    conflicting_policies=conflicting_policies,
    constitutional_framework="Balance efficiency with human oversight"
)
```

## Integration with ACGS-PGP Services

### GS Service Integration

The NVIDIA Qwen client is integrated into the MultiModelManager:

```python
# In MultiModelManager
elif model_name.startswith("qwen/") or model_name.startswith("nvidia/"):
    if self.config.nvidia_api_key and OPENAI_AVAILABLE:
        client = OpenAI(
            base_url="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
            api_key=self.config.nvidia_api_key
        )
        # Enhanced reasoning support for Qwen models
```

### Constitutional Council Workflows

The integration enhances Constitutional Council workflows with:

- **Amendment analysis**: Deep reasoning about constitutional amendments
- **Stakeholder impact assessment**: Multi-perspective analysis of proposed changes
- **Conflict identification**: Proactive identification of potential constitutional conflicts
- **Resolution strategies**: AI-assisted development of conflict resolution approaches

## Performance Characteristics

### Test Results

- ‚úÖ **Constitutional Compliance**: 22.8s response time for structured compliance analysis
- ‚úÖ **Policy Synthesis**: 43.7s response time for comprehensive policy generation

### Token Usage

Typical token usage patterns:
- **Prompt tokens**: 50-200 tokens for constitutional queries
- **Completion tokens**: 1,500-2,500 tokens for detailed analysis
- **Total tokens**: 2,000-3,000 tokens per complex reasoning task

### Response Quality

The model demonstrates:

- **Comprehensive analysis**: Multi-faceted examination of governance issues
- **Practical recommendations**: Actionable policy suggestions
- **Reasoning transparency**: Clear step-by-step reasoning processes

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Engineering

- **Be specific**: Provide clear constitutional context and requirements
- **Request reasoning**: Always enable reasoning for complex governance tasks
- **Structure requests**: Use structured prompts for consistent outputs
- **Provide examples**: Include examples of desired output formats

### 2. Error Handling

```python
try:
    response = await client.generate_constitutional_analysis(prompt)
    if response.success:
        # Process successful response
        process_analysis(response.content, response.reasoning_content)
    else:
        # Handle API errors gracefully
        logger.error(f"Analysis failed: {response.error_message}")
        fallback_to_alternative_model()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    # Implement fallback strategy
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Batch requests**: Group related analyses when possible
- **Cache results**: Cache frequently used constitutional analyses
- **Timeout management**: Use appropriate timeouts for complex reasoning tasks
- **Fallback strategies**: Implement fallback to other models for availability

### 4. Constitutional Fidelity

- **Validate outputs**: Always validate AI-generated policies against constitutional principles
- **Human oversight**: Maintain human review for critical constitutional decisions
- **Audit trails**: Keep detailed logs of AI-assisted constitutional analysis
- **Bias monitoring**: Monitor for potential biases in constitutional interpretation

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

- Store NVIDIA API keys securely in environment variables
- Use key rotation policies for production deployments
- Monitor API usage for anomalous patterns
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Data Privacy

- Constitutional analysis may involve sensitive governance data
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Implement data retention policies for AI interactions
- Consider on-premises deployment for highly sensitive use cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   ```bash
   Error: NVIDIA_API_KEY not found
   Solution: Set NVIDIA_API_KEY environment variable
   ```

2. **Timeout Errors**
   ```python
   # Increase timeout for complex reasoning tasks
   config = QwenModelConfig(timeout_seconds=120)
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   # Implement exponential backoff for rate limits
   await asyncio.sleep(2 ** retry_count)
   ```

### Performance Issues

- **Slow responses**: Normal for complex constitutional reasoning (20-60s)
- **Token limits**: Break large analyses into smaller chunks
- **Memory usage**: Monitor memory usage for long-running processes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Streaming responses**: Real-time reasoning output for better UX
2. **Fine-tuning**: Custom fine-tuning for ACGS-PGP specific use cases
3. **Multi-modal support**: Integration with document and image analysis
4. **Federated deployment**: Support for on-premises NVIDIA deployments

### Research Directions

1. **Constitutional consistency**: Automated consistency checking across policies
2. **Temporal analysis**: Understanding constitutional evolution over time
3. **Cross-jurisdictional analysis**: Comparative constitutional analysis
4. **Predictive governance**: Anticipating constitutional challenges

## Conclusion
