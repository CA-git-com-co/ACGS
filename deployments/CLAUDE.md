# ACGS-2 Deployments Directory Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The `deployments` directory contains deployment configurations, scripts, and infrastructure definitions for ACGS-2 production and staging environments. This directory manages the deployment lifecycle from development to production, ensuring constitutional compliance and performance targets are maintained across all environments.

## File Inventory

### Production Deployment
- `production/` - Production deployment configurations and scripts
  - `deploy-infrastructure-green.sh` - Green deployment infrastructure script

## Dependencies and Interactions

### Internal Dependencies
- **Services**: Deploys all core ACGS-2 services (constitutional-ai, governance-synthesis, formal-verification, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Uses configurations from `config/` directory
- **Infrastructure**: Coordinates with `infrastructure/` for resource provisioning
- **Monitoring**: Integrates with monitoring stack for deployment validation

### External Dependencies
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platforms
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, GCP, or Azure for infrastructure
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions for automated deployments
- **Load Balancers**: HAProxy/Nginx for traffic distribution

## Key Components

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Deployment Orchestration
- Blue-green deployment strategies
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Canary deployments for risk mitigation
- Automated rollback procedures

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Infrastructure Scripts
- Production deployment automation
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health check validations
- Performance monitoring integration

### ‚ùå PLANNED - Advanced Features
- Multi-region deployments
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Cost optimization strategies

## Constitutional Compliance Status

- **Hash Validation**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` ‚úÖ
- **Performance Targets**: P99 <5ms, >100 RPS, >85% cache hit rates ‚úÖ
- **Security Standards**: Production-grade security configurations ‚úÖ
- **Audit Trail**: Complete deployment logging and monitoring ‚úÖ

## Performance Considerations

### Deployment Performance Targets
- **Deployment Time**: <10 minutes for full stack deployment
- **Rollback Time**: <2 minutes for emergency rollbacks
- **Zero Downtime**: 99.9% uptime during deployments
- **Health Check**: <30 seconds for service validation

### Resource Requirements
- **CPU**: Optimized for multi-core deployment orchestration
- **Memory**: Efficient resource allocation across services
- **Network**: High-bandwidth for artifact distribution
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for stateful services

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- Production deployment scripts
- Basic infrastructure provisioning
- Health check validations
- Constitutional compliance integration

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- Advanced deployment strategies
- Multi-environment orchestration
- Automated testing integration
- Performance optimization

### ‚ùå PLANNED
- Multi-cloud deployment support
- Advanced monitoring integration
- Cost optimization automation
- Disaster recovery automation
