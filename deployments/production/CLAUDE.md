# ACGS-2 Production Deployment Directory Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The `deployments/production` directory contains production-specific deployment scripts, configurations, and infrastructure automation for ACGS-2. This directory manages the critical production deployment lifecycle with emphasis on zero-downtime deployments, constitutional compliance, and performance targets.

## File Inventory

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-infrastructure-green.sh` - Green deployment infrastructure automation script

## Dependencies and Interactions

### Internal Dependencies
- **Core Services**: Deploys constitutional-ai, governance-synthesis, formal-verification services
- **Platform Services**: Authentication, integrity, and coordination services
- **Configuration**: Production configurations from `../../config/`
- **Monitoring**: Production monitoring stack integration

### External Dependencies
- **Kubernetes/Docker**: Container orchestration for production workloads
- **Load Balancers**: HAProxy/Nginx for production traffic management
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (port 5439) and Redis (port 6389) clusters
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana production monitoring stack

## Key Components

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Green Deployment Infrastructure
- **deploy-infrastructure-green.sh**: Production infrastructure deployment
  - Zero-downtime green deployment strategy
  - Health check validation
  - Rollback procedures
  - Constitutional compliance verification

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Advanced Production Features
- Blue-green deployment automation
- Canary deployment strategies
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Multi-region deployment support

### ‚ùå PLANNED - Future Enhancements
- Disaster recovery automation
- Cost optimization strategies
- Advanced monitoring integration
- Performance tuning automation

## Constitutional Compliance Status

- **Hash Validation**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` ‚úÖ
- **Performance Targets**: P99 <5ms, >100 RPS, >85% cache hit rates ‚úÖ
- **Security Standards**: Production-grade security hardening ‚úÖ
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete deployment audit trails ‚úÖ

## Performance Considerations

### Production Performance Targets
- **Service Startup**: <30 seconds for all services
- **Health Check Response**: <5 seconds for readiness probes
- **Deployment Time**: <10 minutes for full production deployment
- **Rollback Time**: <2 minutes for emergency rollbacks

### Resource Allocation
- **CPU**: Production-grade multi-core allocation
- **Memory**: Optimized memory allocation per service
- **Network**: High-bandwidth production networking
- **Storage**: Persistent production storage with backups

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
