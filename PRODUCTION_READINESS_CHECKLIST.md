# ACGS-PGP Production Readiness Checklist

This checklist outlines the criteria for declaring the ACGS-PGP system ready for production deployment. All items must be validated and signed off by the respective stakeholders.

## 1. Technical Validation

### 1.1 Constitutional Compliance
- [x] **Constitutional Compliance Score**: Achieved >95% compliance score across all services during testing.
- [x] **Constitutional Hash Consistency**: 100% validation against `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` across all deployed components.
- [ ] **DGM Safety Patterns**: Verified implementation of sandbox, human review, and rollback capabilities.

### 1.2 Performance Validation
- [x] **Throughput**: Sustained ≥1000 RPS during load testing.
- [x] **Response Time**: Achieved ≤2s (p95) response times for all critical operations.
- [x] **Resource Limits**: All services configured with 200m/500m CPU and 512Mi/1Gi memory limits/requests per service.
- [x] **Emergency Shutdown**: Verified <30min RTO capability during emergency shutdown drills.

### 1.3 Security Testing
- [x] **Security Test Coverage**: Achieved >80% security test coverage.
- [ ] **Vulnerability Scan**: All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities addressed and re-scanned.
- [ ] **Penetration Testing**: External penetration test completed with all findings remediated.

### 1.4 Integration Testing
- [x] **Integration Test Success Rate**: Achieved ≥95% integration test success rate.
- [x] **Service Connectivity**: All service-to-service communications verified.
- [x] **External Integrations**: All third-party integrations (e.g., external AI models, blockchain) validated.

### 1.5 Data & Configuration
- [x] **Database Migration**: All schema changes applied and validated in the production environment.
- [x] **Configuration Validation**: All environment-specific configurations verified for production.
- [x] **Backup Strategy**: Database and configuration backup procedures tested and verified.

### 1.6 Monitoring & Observability
- [x] **Monitoring Setup**: Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting configured and operational.
- [x] **Logging**: Centralized logging configured with appropriate retention policies.
- [x] **Alerting**: Critical alerts for constitutional compliance, performance, and security are firing correctly for test cases.

## 2. Operational Readiness

- [ ] **Runbook Availability**: Comprehensive runbooks for common operational procedures (e.g., scaling, troubleshooting, recovery) are available and reviewed.
- [ ] **On-Call Rotation**: On-call rotation established and team members trained.
- [ ] **Incident Management**: Incident response plan defined and communicated.
- [ ] **Disaster Recovery Plan**: DR plan documented and tested.

## 3. Stakeholder Sign-off

All relevant stakeholders must review and sign off on the production readiness.

- [ ] **Technical Lead**: ________________________ Date: ________
- [ ] **Product Owner**: ________________________ Date: ________
- [ ] **Security Officer**: ________________________ Date: ________
- [ ] **Legal/Compliance**: ________________________ Date: ________
- [ ] **Operations Lead**: ________________________ Date: ________

## 4. Rollback Criteria and Emergency Procedures

### 4.1 Rollback Criteria

A rollback will be initiated if any of the following conditions are met post-deployment:
- Constitutional compliance score drops below 90% for more than 10 minutes.
- P95 response times exceed 5 seconds for more than 5 minutes.
- Throughput drops by more than 50% from baseline for more than 5 minutes.
- Critical security alerts are triggered.
- Unrecoverable data corruption is detected.
- Core service health checks fail consistently.

### 4.2 Rollback Procedures

Refer to the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed rollback steps. Typically involves switching traffic back to the previous stable version (blue-green deployment) or scaling down the new deployment.

### 4.3 Emergency Procedures

Refer to the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for emergency shutdown procedures. The goal is to achieve an RTO of <30 minutes.

## 5. Post-Deployment Activities

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor performance metrics against targets.
- [ ] **Security Audits**: Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- [ ] **Compliance Reporting**: Generate regular reports on constitutional compliance.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
