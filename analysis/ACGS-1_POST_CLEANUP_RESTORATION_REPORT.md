## 📋 Cleanup Achievements Preserved

### Root Directory Organization
- **Files Reduced**: 38 → 10 (73.7% reduction) ✅ **MAINTAINED**
- **Essential Files Only**: Core project files preserved
- **Configuration Centralized**: All configs in config/ directory
- **Docker Files Organized**: Moved to infrastructure/docker/

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Import Structure**: Standardized and functional
- **Test Configuration**: Centralized and working
- **Service Architecture**: Preserved and enhanced
- **Documentation**: Updated and organized

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Status

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Test Dependencies**: Some tests require additional packages (pyotp)
2. **Legacy Import References**: Some tests still reference old structure
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Health check shows degraded status (investigation needed)

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ **Service Connectivity**: All services restored
2. ✅ **Import Paths**: Python imports working
3. ✅ **Test Framework**: Basic tests passing
4. ✅ **Performance**: All services within response time targets

## 🚀 Next Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Optional)
1. **Install Missing Dependencies**: `pip install pyotp` for MFA tests
2. **Update Legacy Tests**: Fix remaining path references in tests
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Investigate health check degraded status

### Medium-term
1. **Full Test Suite Run**: Execute comprehensive test coverage analysis
2. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune services for even better response times
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update any remaining path references
