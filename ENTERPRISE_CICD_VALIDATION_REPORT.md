## üîç Critical Issue Analysis

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Pre-flight Infrastructure Validation**
**Previous Issue**: Network connectivity checks failing with ping-based validation  
**Remediation Applied**: Replaced ping with curl commands (commit 1ec8e38)  
**Result**: **‚úÖ COMPLETE SUCCESS** - Infrastructure validation now passes consistently

**Evidence**:
- Job completed successfully in 12 seconds
- All network connectivity tests passed with enhanced error handling
- Infrastructure readiness confirmed with curl-based validation

### ‚ùå **IDENTIFIED: Enterprise Toolchain Setup Failure**
**Current Issue**: Solana CLI installation failure in enterprise toolchain setup  
**Impact**: Blocks Rust/Anchor builds and security scanning  
**Root Cause**: Solana CLI installation timeout or network issues during toolchain setup

**Failure Analysis**:
- Toolchain setup job failed after 22 seconds
- Solana CLI installation step failed (step 6)
- Subsequent steps (Anchor CLI, Node.js, validation) were skipped
- This caused dependent parallel jobs to be skipped

Final Score: 30/100 (NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT)
```

### Compliance Level Assessment
- **Current Level**: NON_COMPLIANT (30/100)
- **Target Level**: ENTERPRISE_COMPLIANT (‚â•90/100)
- **Gap Analysis**: 60-point improvement needed
