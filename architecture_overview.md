# Overview Diagram of ACGS-2 Infrastructure
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the infrastructure components used in the ACGS-2 system.

## Infrastructure Components

- **PostgreSQL**: Utilized for data persistence and relational database management. It is responsible for storing structured data, ensuring ACID properties, and supporting complex queries.
  
- **Redis**: Employed as an in-memory data store, used for caching and real-time data processing to improve system latency and throughput.

- **HAProxy**: Acts as a load balancer to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, enhancing system performance, reliability, and scalability.

- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)**: A general-purpose policy engine that enables the implementation of fine-grained access control policies and governance checks.

- **Prometheus**: Used for monitoring and alerting, collecting metrics from different services and systems to ensure performance goals are met.

- **Grafana**: Provides a dashboarding solution to visualize operational data, helping in monitoring, fault detection, and overall observability.

## Performance Targets and Guardrails

- **P99 Latency**: ≤ 5 ms (for cached data reads: ≤ 2 ms)
- **Throughput**: ≥ 100 RPS, aiming for 1,000 RPS
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ≥ 85%
- **Compliance Rate**: Exactly 100%

These performance targets align with the constitutional guardrails defined by the ACGS-2 guidelines to ensure high availability, compliance, and operational efficiency.
