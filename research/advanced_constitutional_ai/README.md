#### Usage
```python
from semantic_reasoning_engine import AdvancedSemanticReasoningEngine, ConstitutionalDomain, ReasoningMode

# Initialize engine
engine = AdvancedSemanticReasoningEngine()

# Perform constitutional reasoning
reasoning = await engine.reason_about_query(
    query="Should this AI system have access to personal data?",
    domain=ConstitutionalDomain.PRIVACY,
    reasoning_modes=[ReasoningMode.DEDUCTIVE, ReasoningMode.DEONTIC]
)

print(f"Constitutional Compliance: {reasoning.constitutional_compliance}")

#### Usage
```python
from multimodal_constitutional_ai import MultiModalConstitutionalAI, ModalityInput, ModalityType

# Initialize system
system = MultiModalConstitutionalAI()

# Analyze text content
text_input = ModalityInput(
    modality=ModalityType.TEXT,
    content="Policy text to analyze",
    metadata={"source": "policy_doc"},
    timestamp=datetime.now()
)

analysis = await system.analyze_text(text_input)
print(f"Constitutional Compliance: {analysis.constitutional_compliance}")
print(f"Violations: {[v.value for v in analysis.violations]}")
```

### 3. Federated Governance (`federated_governance.py`)

Cross-organizational policy harmonization and distributed constitutional governance.

#### Features
- **Federated Network**: Multi-organization governance network
- **Policy Harmonization**: Conflict resolution and policy alignment
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Democratic voting and consensus building
- **Cryptographic Security**: Secure inter-organizational communication

#### Network Roles
- **Coordinator**: Central coordination node
- **Participant**: Regular participating organization
- **Observer**: Read-only observer
- **Validator**: Policy validation node
- **Arbitrator**: Conflict resolution node

#### Usage
```python
from federated_governance import FederatedGovernanceSystem, GovernanceRole

# Create federated node
node = FederatedGovernanceSystem("org1", "Organization 1", GovernanceRole.PARTICIPANT)

# Propose policy
policy_id = await node.propose_policy(
    title="Data Privacy Policy",
    content="All personal data must be encrypted",
    domain="privacy"
)

# Detect conflicts
conflicts = await node.detect_conflicts()

# Propose harmonization
if conflicts:
    harmony_id = await node.propose_harmonization([policy_id])
```

### 4. AI Safety Integration (`ai_safety_integration.py`)

Integration of cutting-edge AI safety research into constitutional AI systems.

#### Safety Research Areas
- **Alignment**: Human preference and value alignment
- **Interpretability**: Model explanation and understanding
- **Robustness**: Adversarial and distributional robustness
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence and calibration
- **Value Learning**: Human value acquisition
- **Constitutional AI**: Constitutional principle adherence

#### Safety Evaluators
- **AlignmentEvaluator**: Evaluates AI alignment with human values
- **InterpretabilityEvaluator**: Assesses model interpretability
- **RobustnessEvaluator**: Tests model robustness and safety

#### Usage
```python
from ai_safety_integration import AISafetyIntegrationSystem

# Initialize system
system = AISafetyIntegrationSystem()

# Perform comprehensive safety evaluation
evaluations = await system.comprehensive_safety_evaluation(model, data)

# Generate safety report
report = system.generate_safety_report(evaluations)
print(f"Overall Safety Score: {report['overall_safety_score']:.2f}")
```
