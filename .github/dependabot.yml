# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

version: 2
updates:
  # Python (pip)
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"                  # Root directory (adjust if requirements.txt or pyproject.toml is elsewhere)
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10

  # Python (pip) in subdirectories (optional, add if you have requirements in subfolders)
  # - package-ecosystem: "pip"
  #   directory: "/subfolder/"
