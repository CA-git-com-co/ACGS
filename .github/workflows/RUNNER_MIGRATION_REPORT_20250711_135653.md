## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations

1. **Review migrated workflows** in the next CI/CD run
2. **Monitor performance** differences between runner types
3. **Update documentation** with new runner strategy
4. **Consider caching** strategies for GitHub-hosted runners
5. **Set up alerts** for workflow failures during transition
