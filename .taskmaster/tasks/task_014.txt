# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Distributed Tracing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a distributed tracing system to monitor and optimize performance across all services.
# Details:
Implement distributed tracing using Jaeger (version 1.25 or later) or Zipkin (version 2.23 or later). Instrument all 7 core services to generate trace data. Use OpenTelemetry for standardized instrumentation across different languages and frameworks. Configure sampling rates to balance performance and data collection. Integrate trace visualization with existing monitoring dashboards.

# Test Strategy:
Develop test scenarios that exercise all major system workflows. Verify that trace data is correctly generated, collected, and visualized. Conduct performance impact assessment to ensure tracing doesn't significantly affect system response times.
