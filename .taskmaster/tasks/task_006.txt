# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement PostgreSQL Connection Pooling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and configure PostgreSQL connection pooling to optimize database performance and support increased concurrent users.
# Details:
Implement PgBouncer (latest stable version) as the connection pooling solution. Configure connection pools for each of the 7 core services. Optimize pool sizes based on expected concurrent users (target >1000). Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers using a library like Hystrix or resilience4j. Update application code to use pooled connections efficiently.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct load testing to verify improved connection handling. Monitor connection pool metrics under various load conditions. Perform failover testing to ensure resilience.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure PgBouncer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the latest stable version of PgBouncer and set up the basic configuration for connection pooling.
### Details:
Install PgBouncer on the database server or dedicated middleware servers. Configure the main pgbouncer.ini file with appropriate authentication settings, log levels, and connection to the PostgreSQL server. Set up user authentication via auth_file. Configure listen addresses and ports. Implement systemd service for automatic startup and restart.

## 2. Configure Connection Pools for Core Services [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and optimize separate connection pools for each of the 7 core services with appropriate pool sizes and settings.
### Details:
Define separate database pools in pgbouncer.ini for each core service. Configure pool_mode (transaction/session/statement) based on service requirements. Set default_pool_size, min_pool_size, and max_pool_size based on expected concurrent users (aim for >1000 total). Configure max_client_conn appropriately. Implement connection timeout settings and idle timeout to prevent resource exhaustion.

## 3. Implement Retry Mechanisms and Circuit Breakers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate resilience patterns into application code to handle database connection failures gracefully.
### Details:
Select and integrate resilience4j library into the application codebase. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient database errors. Configure circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when database connectivity issues occur. Set appropriate thresholds for circuit opening/closing based on error rates. Add fallback mechanisms for critical operations when database is unavailable.

## 4. Set Up Read Replicas and Connection Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure PgBouncer to route read and write operations to appropriate database instances.
### Details:
Set up PostgreSQL read replicas for scaling read operations. Configure PgBouncer to route read queries to replicas and write operations to the primary instance. Implement query routing rules in application code or via middleware. Configure health checks to detect replica lag or failures. Set up failover mechanisms to redirect traffic if a replica becomes unavailable.

## 5. Implement Monitoring and Performance Tuning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring for connection pools and optimize performance based on real-world usage patterns.
### Details:
Integrate PgBouncer metrics with existing monitoring system (Prometheus/Grafana). Create dashboards for connection pool utilization, wait times, and error rates. Configure alerts for pool exhaustion and connection timeouts. Analyze query patterns and adjust pool configurations based on production usage. Implement regular maintenance procedures for PgBouncer (log rotation, configuration updates). Document performance tuning guidelines for the team.
