# Task ID: 7
# Title: Deploy Redis Cluster for Distributed Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a Redis cluster to implement distributed caching, improving system performance and scalability.
# Details:
Deploy a Redis cluster (version 6.2 or later) with at least 3 nodes for high availability. Implement sharding to distribute data across nodes. Configure appropriate persistence settings (RDB and AOF). Integrate Redis caching into all 7 core services, focusing on frequently accessed data and computationally expensive operations. Implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Perform benchmarking tests to measure performance improvements. Conduct failover tests to ensure cluster resilience. Verify cache hit rates and monitor memory usage across the cluster.
