# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Enhanced Multi-Model Consensus Algorithms
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and integrate advanced multi-model consensus algorithms to improve governance decision-making.
# Details:
Research and implement advanced consensus algorithms such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) or Raft. Develop a pluggable consensus module that can support multiple algorithms. Integrate with existing governance workflows. Implement performance optimizations for high-throughput consensus operations. Ensure compatibility with the Quantumagi Solana deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Develop comprehensive unit tests for each consensus algorithm. Perform integration testing with existing governance workflows. Conduct performance benchmarks to measure throughput and latency. Test fault tolerance by simulating various network and node failure scenarios.
