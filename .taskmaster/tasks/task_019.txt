# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Infrastructure as Code
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts for automated and consistent environment provisioning.
# Details:
Use Terraform (version 1.0 or later) for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible (version 2.11 or later) for configuration management. Develop Terraform modules for all infrastructure components (VMs, networks, load balancers, databases). Create Ansible playbooks for service deployment and configuration. Implement version control for all IaC scripts. Set up a secure method for managing sensitive data (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).

# Test Strategy:
Perform regular test deployments of the entire infrastructure stack. Validate idempotency of Terraform and Ansible scripts. Conduct disaster recovery tests by rebuilding the entire environment from IaC scripts.
