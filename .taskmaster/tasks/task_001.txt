# Task ID: 1
# Title: Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and categorize all vulnerabilities, with a focus on the 24 HIGH severity findings.
# Details:
Use industry-standard security scanning tools like Bandit, SonarQube, and OWASP ZAP to perform a thorough security audit. Pay special attention to the 24 HIGH severity findings mentioned in the PRD. Document all findings in a detailed report, categorizing them by severity and potential impact. Use the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) to prioritize vulnerabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all existing vulnerabilities are properly identified and documented. Cross-check findings with manual code review and penetration testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Automated Vulnerability Scanning [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and execute automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify security issues across all application components
### Details:
Configure and run industry-standard security scanning tools including OWASP ZAP for dynamic application scanning, Bandit for Python code analysis, and SonarQube for static code analysis. Generate comprehensive reports that identify vulnerabilities with their CVSS scores. Focus on identifying injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and XML external entities.

## 2. Manual Code Security Review [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Perform a thorough manual review of critical codebase components focusing on security-sensitive areas
### Details:
Conduct line-by-line code review of authentication mechanisms, authorization controls, input validation, output encoding, and cryptographic implementations. Use a checklist approach based on OWASP Top 10 and SANS Top 25. Document all potential vulnerabilities found, including those that automated tools might miss, such as business logic flaws and complex authorization issues.

## 3. Third-Party Dependency Audit [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze all third-party libraries, packages, and dependencies for known vulnerabilities and security issues
### Details:
Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, npm audit, or Snyk to scan all project dependencies. Create an inventory of all third-party components with their versions, licenses, and known CVEs. Identify outdated dependencies and those with security advisories. Prioritize findings based on severity and exploitability in our specific implementation context.

## 4. Penetration Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Conduct controlled penetration testing against the application to identify exploitable vulnerabilities
### Details:
Perform both authenticated and unauthenticated penetration testing using a combination of manual techniques and specialized tools. Focus on the 24 HIGH severity findings from previous scans. Test for authentication bypass, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, and injection attacks. Document successful exploitation paths, including screenshots and steps to reproduce.

## 5. Compliance and Standards Verification [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Assess the application against relevant security standards and compliance requirements
### Details:
Review the application against applicable security standards such as OWASP ASVS, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, and industry-specific regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). Create a compliance matrix mapping application controls to requirements. Identify compliance gaps and document remediation needs.

## 6. Comprehensive Security Report and Remediation Plan [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Compile all security findings into a detailed report with prioritized remediation recommendations
### Details:
Create a comprehensive security report that consolidates and deduplicates findings from all assessment activities. Categorize vulnerabilities by severity using CVSS scores, with special focus on the 24 HIGH severity issues. Include detailed technical descriptions, impact assessments, and exploitation scenarios. Develop a prioritized remediation plan with specific recommendations, estimated effort, and suggested timelines. Include both quick wins and strategic security improvements.
