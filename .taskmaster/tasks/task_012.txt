# Task ID: 12
# Title: Expand Prometheus Metrics Collection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the existing Prometheus setup with custom business metrics for comprehensive system observability.
# Details:
Identify key business metrics for each of the 7 core services. Implement custom Prometheus exporters or integrate with application code to expose these metrics. Use the latest stable version of Prometheus client libraries for each service's programming language. Configure Prometheus (version 2.30 or later) to scrape these new metrics. Update alerting rules to incorporate business metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all custom metrics are being correctly collected and stored in Prometheus. Create test scenarios to generate various metric values and ensure accurate reporting. Validate that alerting rules function correctly based on the new metrics.
