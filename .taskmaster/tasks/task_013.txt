# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop high-level Grafana dashboards that provide executive insights into system performance and business metrics.
# Details:
Design and implement Grafana dashboards (Grafana version 8.0 or later) that visualize key performance indicators and business metrics. Create separate dashboard views for different stakeholder levels (e.g., technical operations, business operations, executive overview). Implement drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis. Use Grafana alerting features to set up notifications for critical metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders to ensure dashboards meet their information needs. Verify that all metrics are accurately represented and real-time updates are functioning. Test alert notifications to ensure timely delivery to appropriate parties.
