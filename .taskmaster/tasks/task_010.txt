# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Async Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate asynchronous processing capabilities to handle time-consuming operations without impacting API response times.
# Details:
Identify operations suitable for asynchronous processing across all services. Implement a message queue system using RabbitMQ (version 3.9 or later) or Apache Kafka (version 2.8 or later). Develop worker processes to handle asynchronous tasks. Implement a job status tracking mechanism. Update API endpoints to initiate async jobs and provide status updates.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for async job processing. Perform integration tests to ensure proper interaction between API endpoints and async workers. Conduct load tests to verify that async processing improves overall system performance.
