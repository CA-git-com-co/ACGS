# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement HAProxy Load Balancing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy and configure HAProxy for load balancing with circuit breaker patterns to improve system reliability and performance.
# Details:
Install and configure HAProxy (version 2.4 or later) as the load balancer. Set up load balancing rules for all 7 core services. Implement health checks and failover mechanisms. Configure circuit breaker patterns using HAProxy's built-in features or integrate with a service mesh solution like Istio. Optimize HAProxy configuration for high concurrency (>1000 users).

# Test Strategy:
Conduct load balancing tests to ensure even distribution of traffic. Simulate service failures to test failover and circuit breaker functionality. Perform high concurrency tests to validate system behavior under load.
