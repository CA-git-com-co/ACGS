# Task ID: 9
# Title: API Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize API performance across all services to achieve <500ms response times for 95% of requests.
# Details:
Profile each service to identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize database queries using indexing and query optimization techniques. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data. Use asynchronous processing for time-consuming operations (e.g., Node.js async/await or Python asyncio). Optimize network calls between services. Consider implementing GraphQL (using Apollo Server or similar) for more efficient data fetching.

# Test Strategy:
Develop comprehensive performance test suites using tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling. Measure response times under various load conditions. Verify that 95% of requests meet the <500ms target. Conduct long-running performance tests to identify any degradation over time.
