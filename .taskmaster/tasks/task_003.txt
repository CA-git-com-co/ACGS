# Task ID: 3
# Title: Upgrade Cryptographic Implementations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace all instances of MD5 with SHA-256 for improved cryptographic security across the system.
# Details:
Identify all occurrences of MD5 usage in the codebase. Replace with SHA-256 using the latest cryptographic libraries (e.g., Python's hashlib or Node.js's crypto module). Update any dependent systems or databases that may be affected by this change. Ensure that all data previously hashed with MD5 is rehashed using SHA-256.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests to verify SHA-256 implementation. Perform system-wide integration tests to ensure no regressions in functionality. Conduct performance testing to measure any impact on response times.
