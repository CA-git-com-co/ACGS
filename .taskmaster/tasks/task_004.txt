Integrate a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) version 7.13 or later. Configure log aggregation from all 7 core services. Set up custom dashboards in Kibana for security event visualization. Implement automated alerting for suspicious activities using Elastalert.
