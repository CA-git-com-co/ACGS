# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Intelligent Alerting with Automated Remediation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an advanced alerting system with automated remediation capabilities for common issues.
# Details:
Enhance existing Prometheus alerting with more sophisticated rules. Integrate with an incident management platform like PagerDuty or OpsGenie. Implement automated remediation scripts for common issues (e.g., service restarts, cache clearing). Use a workflow automation tool like StackStorm (version 3.4 or later) for complex remediation scenarios. Develop an escalation policy for alerts that can't be automatically resolved.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate various alert conditions to test detection and notification accuracy. Verify automated remediation actions for effectiveness and safety. Conduct failure scenario testing to ensure proper escalation of critical issues.
