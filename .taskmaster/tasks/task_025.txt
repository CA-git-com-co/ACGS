# Task ID: 25
# Title: Research Quantum-Resistant Governance Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Conduct research and prototype quantum-resistant cryptographic methods for future-proofing the governance system.
# Details:
Research post-quantum cryptographic algorithms recommended by NIST. Implement prototypes of quantum-resistant digital signatures and key exchange mechanisms. Evaluate the performance impact of post-quantum algorithms on existing governance workflows. Develop a migration strategy for transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography. Create a report on the feasibility and timeline for full quantum resistance.

# Test Strategy:
Develop benchmarks to compare the performance of quantum-resistant algorithms with current cryptographic methods. Create test scenarios to validate the security properties of implemented post-quantum prototypes. Conduct peer reviews of the research findings and prototypes.
