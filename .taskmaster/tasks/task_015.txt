# Title: Implement Log Aggregation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a centralized log aggregation system for improved troubleshooting and analysis capabilities.
# Details:
Deploy the ELK stack (Elasticsearch 7.13+, Logstash 7.13+, Kibana 7.13+) for log aggregation. Configure log shipping from all 7 core services using Filebeat or Fluentd. Implement log parsing and structuring in Logstash. Create Kibana dashboards for log analysis and visualization. Set up log retention policies and index lifecycle management in Elasticsearch.

# Test Strategy:
Verify log collection from all services under various operating conditions. Test log parsing accuracy and performance. Conduct searches and analysis in Kibana to ensure all required information is accessible. Validate log retention and rotation policies.
