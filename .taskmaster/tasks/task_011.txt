# Task ID: 11
# Title: Comprehensive Load Testing and Capacity Planning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct extensive load testing to verify support for >1000 concurrent users and perform capacity planning for future scalability.
# Details:
Develop comprehensive load testing scenarios using tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling. Simulate various user behaviors and transaction types across all services. Gradually increase load to identify system bottlenecks and breaking points. Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O) during tests. Analyze results to determine current capacity and project future resource needs. Create a capacity planning report with recommendations for infrastructure scaling.

# Test Strategy:
Execute load tests in a staging environment that closely mirrors production. Verify that the system can handle >1000 concurrent users while maintaining performance targets. Conduct extended duration tests (e.g., 24 hours) to identify any performance degradation over time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up dedicated load testing environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an isolated environment that mirrors production for accurate load testing without impacting other systems.
### Details:
Provision servers matching production specifications but in an isolated network. Install all application components, databases, and dependencies. Configure monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) to capture metrics. Ensure the environment is properly isolated but accessible for testing tools.

## 2. Configure load testing tools and create test scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Install and configure JMeter or Gatling and develop realistic test scenarios that simulate actual user behaviors.
### Details:
Install JMeter/Gatling on dedicated test controller machines. Create test scripts for all critical user journeys (login, search, checkout, etc.). Configure realistic think times between actions. Set up parameterization for dynamic data. Create test data sets that won't interfere with production data.

## 3. Establish performance baseline and define SLAs [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Run initial tests to establish current performance metrics and define acceptable service level agreements (SLAs) for the application.
### Details:
Run baseline tests with 50-100 concurrent users. Measure response times for all key transactions. Establish throughput metrics (transactions per second). Document resource utilization patterns. Define SLAs for response times, error rates, and throughput based on business requirements.

## 4. Execute incremental load tests and identify bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Gradually increase user load to identify system breaking points and performance bottlenecks across all services.
### Details:
Execute test scenarios with incrementally increasing user loads (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000+ users). Monitor all system components during tests. Identify when response times begin to degrade. Pinpoint specific bottlenecks (CPU, memory, network, database queries, etc.). Document all findings with supporting metrics.

## 5. Perform stress testing and failure mode analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Push the system beyond expected capacity to understand failure modes and recovery capabilities.
### Details:
Run tests that exceed the 1000 concurrent user target (e.g., 1500, 2000 users). Identify exact breaking points and failure patterns. Test system recovery after overload. Simulate component failures (e.g., database unavailability) during load. Document all failure modes and recovery times.

## 6. Create capacity planning report with optimization recommendations [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Analyze all test results to create a comprehensive capacity planning report with specific scaling and optimization recommendations.
### Details:
Analyze resource utilization patterns across all tests. Project resource needs for 2x and 3x current load. Identify specific optimization opportunities (code, queries, caching, etc.). Create scaling recommendations for each component (horizontal vs. vertical). Include cost estimates for recommended infrastructure changes. Prioritize optimizations based on ROI.
