# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Blue-Green Deployments
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a blue-green deployment system with automated rollback capabilities for all services.
# Details:
Implement blue-green deployment architecture using container orchestration with Kubernetes (version 1.21 or later). Set up separate blue and green environments for each service. Develop scripts for automated environment switching and health checks. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) for automated deployments. Implement automated rollback procedures based on health check results.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct multiple test deployments to verify smooth transition between blue and green environments. Simulate deployment failures to test automated rollback functionality. Verify zero-downtime deployments under various load conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Blue-Green Environments in Kubernetes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up separate blue and green environments for each service in Kubernetes, including namespace configuration, deployment manifests, and service resources.
### Details:
Create Kubernetes namespace definitions for blue and green environments. Develop deployment YAML templates that include environment-specific labels and selectors. Configure Kubernetes services with label selectors that can be switched between blue and green deployments. Set up resource quotas and limits for both environments. Ensure proper network policies are in place for isolation between environments.

## 2. Develop Health Check System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive health check mechanisms for validating deployment readiness and monitoring application health during and after deployments.
### Details:
Create readiness and liveness probe configurations for all services. Implement application-specific health check endpoints that validate critical functionality. Develop a centralized health monitoring service that aggregates health status from all services. Configure alerting thresholds for health degradation. Implement health check dashboards for visibility during deployments.

## 3. Implement Deployment Automation Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create automation scripts for managing the blue-green deployment process, including environment preparation, traffic switching, and post-deployment verification.
### Details:
Develop shell or Python scripts that handle the deployment workflow. Implement functions for preparing the inactive environment, deploying new versions, running pre-switch validation, switching traffic, and post-deployment verification. Include logging and error handling for all operations. Create configuration files for environment-specific parameters. Implement command-line interfaces for manual control when needed.

## 4. Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the blue-green deployment system with the existing CI/CD pipeline to enable automated deployments triggered by code changes.
### Details:
Configure CI/CD pipeline stages for blue-green deployments in Jenkins or GitLab CI. Create pipeline templates that call the deployment automation scripts. Implement approval gates for production deployments. Set up environment-specific configuration management. Configure pipeline notifications for deployment events. Implement deployment metrics collection for CI/CD dashboards.

## 5. Implement Automated Rollback Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop automated rollback capabilities that can detect deployment issues and revert to the previous stable version without manual intervention.
### Details:
Implement health check monitoring during the deployment process. Create threshold definitions for triggering automatic rollbacks. Develop rollback scripts that can revert traffic to the previous environment. Implement state tracking to maintain awareness of which environment is currently active. Create notification systems for rollback events. Implement post-rollback diagnostics to capture failure information.
