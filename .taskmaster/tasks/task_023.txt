# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Predictive Governance Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop AI-powered predictive analytics capabilities for governance optimization.
# Details:
Implement machine learning models (using libraries like TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch 1.9+) for predicting governance outcomes. Develop data pipelines for collecting and preprocessing governance-related data. Create APIs for integrating predictive analytics into the decision-making process. Implement model versioning and A/B testing capabilities. Ensure explainability of AI decisions using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

# Test Strategy:
Develop a test dataset for validating predictive model accuracy. Implement automated testing of model performance and drift detection. Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure the predictive analytics integrate smoothly with governance workflows. Test the explainability features to ensure transparency of AI-driven decisions.
