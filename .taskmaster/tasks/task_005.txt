# Task ID: 5
# Title: Resolve HIGH Severity Security Findings
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Address and resolve all 24 HIGH severity security findings identified in the initial security audit.
# Details:
Prioritize the 24 HIGH severity findings based on their CVSS scores. Develop a remediation plan for each finding, including specific code changes, configuration updates, or architectural modifications. Implement fixes using best practices and secure coding guidelines. Pay special attention to common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. Use secure coding libraries and frameworks where applicable (e.g., parameterized queries for database operations).

# Test Strategy:
Develop specific test cases for each resolved vulnerability. Perform regression testing to ensure fixes don't introduce new issues. Conduct a follow-up security scan to verify that all HIGH severity findings have been addressed.
