ACGS-1 Phase A3: Advanced Features and Production Optimization
Product Requirements Document

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
Phase A3 builds on Phase A2's successful security improvements (88.3/100 security score, 60% reduction in critical vulnerabilities) to implement enterprise-grade production features while maintaining full Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment functionality.

OBJECTIVES
==========
1. Production-Grade API Implementation for all 7 core services
2. Complete Policy Synthesis Engine Enhancement with multi-model consensus
3. Advanced Governance Workflows Implementation (5 workflows operational)
4. Enterprise Scalability Architecture supporting >1000 concurrent actions
5. Comprehensive Performance Validation with <500ms response times

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
======================

1. PRODUCTION-GRADE API IMPLEMENTATION
   - Replace minimal FastAPI implementations with comprehensive production APIs
   - Implement proper error handling with structured error responses
   - Add input validation with Pydantic models
   - Create comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
   - Deploy rate limiting and security middleware
   - Target: <50ms response times for PGC service endpoints, 100% API documentation coverage

2. COMPLETE POLICY SYNTHESIS ENGINE ENHANCEMENT
   - Implement full policy synthesis engine in GS service (port 8004)
   - Deploy four-tier risk-based strategy selection (standard/enhanced_validation/multi_model_consensus/human_review)
   - Create multi-model consensus engine for high-risk scenarios
   - Add proactive error prediction and structured risk assessment
   - Target: >50% synthesis error reduction, <2s response times for 95% operations, >95% accuracy

3. ADVANCED GOVERNANCE WORKFLOWS IMPLEMENTATION
   - Ensure all 5 governance workflows fully operational: Policy Creation, Constitutional Compliance, Policy Enforcement, WINA Oversight, Audit/Transparency
   - Implement complete workflow orchestration (draft→review→voting→implementation)
   - Create PGC-AC service integration
   - Target: End-to-end testing with >95% constitutional compliance accuracy, 100% workflow completion rates

4. ENTERPRISE SCALABILITY ARCHITECTURE
   - Implement support for >1000 concurrent governance actions
   - Deploy advanced caching (Redis/Memcached)
   - Optimize database performance
   - Add load balancing capabilities
   - Deploy Prometheus/Grafana monitoring with comprehensive performance metrics
   - Target: <500ms response times for 95% requests, >99.9% availability, >90% test coverage

5. COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE VALIDATION
   - Validate all Phase A3 targets through systematic testing
   - Ensure complete workflow orchestration
   - Maintain 100% compatibility with existing Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment
   - Constitution hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2, core policies POL-001/002/003

EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
======================
- Use Task Master CLI for structured task completion tracking with JSON progress reports
- Follow host-based deployment architecture (preferred over Docker for service restoration)
- Maintain existing Quantumagi deployment functionality throughout all Phase A3 activities
- Implement enterprise-grade standards while preserving constitutional governance system integrity
- Achieve >95% success rate requirement before production deployment
- Use codebase-retrieval tool for detailed analysis before making any code modifications
- Follow established ACGS-1 patterns: Anchor programs in blockchain/programs/, core services in services/core/

SUCCESS CRITERIA
================
- All 7 core services operational with production-grade APIs
- Complete policy synthesis engine with multi-model consensus
- All 5 governance workflows fully functional with end-to-end validation
- Performance targets achieved: <500ms response times, >99.9% availability, >1000 concurrent users
- Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment preserved and enhanced
- Task Master CLI completion tracking with structured progress reports
- >95% success rate requirement met before production deployment

PRIORITY SERVICES FOR ENHANCEMENT
=================================
1. Integrity Service (8002) - Currently minimal, needs full production implementation
2. Auth Service (8000) - Enhance enterprise features and production readiness
3. GS Service (8004) - Complete policy synthesis engine with multi-model consensus
4. All Services - Add comprehensive monitoring, caching, and scalability features

PERFORMANCE TARGETS
===================
- Response Times: <500ms for 95% of requests, <50ms for PGC endpoints
- Availability: >99.9% uptime
- Scalability: >1000 concurrent governance actions
- Test Coverage: >90% across all services
- Accuracy: >95% constitutional compliance validation
- Error Reduction: >50% synthesis error reduction
