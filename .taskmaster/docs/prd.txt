# ACGS-PGP Phase 4.3: Legacy Deprecation and Monitoring - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the systematic implementation of Phase 4.3 for the ACGS-PGP frontend migration, focusing on comprehensive legacy deprecation planning, integration monitoring systems, and performance validation while maintaining full operational capability of the Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: ACGS-1 operates with dual frontend architectures requiring systematic legacy deprecation and comprehensive monitoring to complete the migration to a unified, enterprise-grade governance system.

**Architecture Overview**:
- **governance-dashboard**: Modern TypeScript React application with shared services
- **legacy-frontend**: Legacy JavaScript React application for backward compatibility
- **Shared Services**: Centralized authentication, API communication, and service integrations
- **7 Core ACGS Services**: Auth (8002), AC (8001), Integrity (8006), FV (8004), GS (8003), PGC (8005), EC (8007)

**Migration Requirements**:
- Systematic legacy component deprecation without service disruption
- Comprehensive monitoring for all ACGS service integrations
- Performance validation and improvement measurement
- Operational continuity for Quantumagi constitutional governance workflows

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Legacy Deprecation Planning**: Complete systematic deprecation roadmap for legacy-frontend components
2. **Integration Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for all 7 ACGS service integrations
3. **Performance Validation**: Establish and validate performance improvements from migration
4. **Operational Continuity**: Ensure zero disruption to Quantumagi constitutional governance workflows

### Performance Targets
- Response Times: <500ms for 95% requests, >99.5% uptime
- Governance Costs: <0.01 SOL per governance action
- Concurrent Users: >1000 users support
- Test Coverage: >80% maintained across all migrated components
- Availability: >99.9% for all 5 governance workflows

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Legacy Audit and Deprecation Planning
**Task 1: Legacy Frontend Codebase Audit**
- Comprehensive analysis of legacy-frontend components, services, and patterns
- Identification of deprecated authentication flows and service integrations
- Documentation of UI components requiring migration or replacement
- Assessment of backward compatibility requirements for critical workflows

**Task 2: Deprecation Roadmap Creation**
- Detailed migration timeline with specific milestones for legacy component deprecation
- Breaking changes documentation with comprehensive migration guides
- Feature flag implementation for gradual rollout and rollback capabilities
- Risk assessment for each deprecated component and mitigation strategies

### Phase 2: Integration Monitoring Infrastructure
**Task 3: Service Health Monitoring Setup**
- Real-time monitoring deployment for all 7 ACGS services (Auth:8002, AC:8001, Integrity:8006, FV:8004, GS:8003, PGC:8005, EC:8007)
- Health check endpoints creation and dashboard configuration
- Performance tracking for availability, response times, and error rates
- Automated alerting systems for service failures and performance degradation

**Task 4: API Compatibility Monitoring**
- Monitoring system for API compatibility between legacy and new implementations
- User adoption metrics tracking and integration issue identification
- Constitutional compliance violation detection and alerting
- Cross-service communication validation and error tracking

### Phase 3: Performance Validation Framework
**Task 5: Baseline Performance Metrics**
- Establishment of baseline performance metrics from current legacy-frontend implementation
- Performance testing suite deployment measuring bundle size, loading times, memory usage
- Shared component architecture improvement validation
- Development velocity and code reusability metrics collection

**Task 6: Quantumagi Integration Validation**
- Comprehensive validation of Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment functionality
- Constitutional governance workflow preservation verification
- End-to-end testing of all 5 governance workflows operational status
- Performance target achievement confirmation and documentation

## Architecture Requirements

### Integration Constraints
- **Quantumagi Compatibility**: Maintain existing Solana devnet deployment functionality throughout migration
- **ACGS-1 Services**: Preserve seven core services architecture (Auth, AC, Integrity, FV, GS, PGC, EC)
- **Constitutional Governance**: Ensure all 5 governance workflows remain operational during transition
- **Performance Standards**: Enterprise-grade targets maintained with <500ms response times, >99.5% uptime

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, shared services architecture, feature flags
- **Backend**: 7 ACGS microservices with REST APIs and health check endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana, custom dashboards, automated alerting
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, integration test suites, performance testing
- **Deployment**: Host-based architecture with Docker containerization support

### Governance Workflows
1. **Policy Creation**: Constitutional principle-to-policy synthesis workflow
2. **Constitutional Compliance**: Real-time PGC validation and enforcement
3. **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance checking and violation handling
4. **WINA Oversight**: Weighted Intelligence Network Authority coordination
5. **Audit/Transparency**: Comprehensive logging and audit trail management

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Service Disruption**: Legacy deprecation may impact critical governance workflows
2. **Performance Degradation**: Monitoring overhead may affect system performance
3. **Integration Failures**: API compatibility issues between legacy and new implementations
4. **User Experience**: Transition period may cause confusion or workflow interruption

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Deprecation**: Gradual phase-out with feature flags and rollback capabilities
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive validation before any component deprecation
3. **Monitoring First**: Deploy monitoring infrastructure before deprecation activities
4. **User Communication**: Clear documentation and migration guides for all changes
