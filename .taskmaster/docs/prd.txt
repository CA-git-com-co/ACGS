# ACGS-1 PR #117 CI/CD Failure Remediation - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the systematic remediation workflow for critical CI/CD pipeline failures identified in ACGS-1 PR #117 post-merge validation. The project addresses 5 workflow failures across 4 pipelines, with 2 critical/high severity blocking issues that prevent safe blockchain deployment.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: ACGS-1 PR #117 merge resulted in 80% CI/CD pipeline failure rate (4/5 workflows failed) with critical security and compilation issues blocking Solana blockchain development.

**Critical Issues Identified**:
- CRITICAL: Rust security audit failures (potential vulnerabilities undetected)
- HIGH: Rust clippy compilation failures (blocks Anchor program builds)
- MEDIUM: Multiple security scanning tool failures (CodeQL, MSDO, detect-secrets)

**Impact**:
- Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment: BLOCKED
- Constitutional governance system: AT RISK
- Performance targets: Cannot be validated
- Security posture: COMPROMISED

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Zero Critical/High Severity Failures**: Resolve all blocking CI/CD issues within 4-hour deadline
2. **Security Compliance**: Achieve 100% security audit pass rate (cargo audit + cargo deny)
3. **Blockchain Pipeline Restoration**: Successful Solana Anchor program compilation and testing
4. **Performance Validation**: Confirm <0.01 SOL costs, <2s response times, >99.5% uptime

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Security Tool Restoration**: Achieve ≥80% security scanning tool success rate
2. **Pipeline Stability**: Establish 24-48 hour monitoring for sustained stability
3. **Documentation**: Complete CVE tracking and remediation documentation
4. **Future Prevention**: Implement enhanced pre-merge validation criteria

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Critical Priority (0-4 hours)
**Task 1: Rust Security Audit Remediation**
- Working Directory: `/home/dislove/ACGS-1/blockchain`
- Commands: `cargo audit --fix`, `cargo deny check --fix`
- Success Criteria: Zero RUSTSEC critical vulnerabilities
- Dependencies: None (immediate execution)

**Task 2: Rust Clippy Resolution**
- Working Directory: `/home/dislove/ACGS-1/blockchain`
- Commands: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo fix --allow-dirty`
- Success Criteria: Clean clippy run with zero warnings
- Dependencies: Task 1 completion

### Phase 2: High Priority (4-12 hours)
**Task 3: Security Scanning Infrastructure Restoration**
- Fix detect-secrets baseline configuration
- Resolve Microsoft Defender for DevOps Windows environment issues
- Update CodeQL Rust analysis for Rust 1.81.0 compatibility
- Target: ≥80% security scanning success rate

**Task 4: Blockchain Pipeline Validation**
- Re-trigger Solana Anchor Programs CI workflow
- Validate Anchor builds with Solana CLI v1.18.22 + Anchor v0.29.0
- Execute comprehensive test suite including PGC compliance checks
- Confirm Quantumagi deployment readiness

### Phase 3: Validation and Monitoring (12-24 hours)
**Task 5: End-to-End Validation**
- Verify all 5 CI/CD workflows pass successfully
- Validate constitutional governance workflow functionality
- Confirm performance targets achievement
- Generate compliance documentation

**Task 6: Monitoring and Reporting**
- Implement 2-hour status update cycles during critical phase
- Generate JSON-formatted progress reports
- Establish 24-48 hour stability monitoring
- Create final validation report

## Architecture Requirements

### Integration Constraints
- **Quantumagi Compatibility**: Maintain existing Solana devnet deployment functionality
- **ACGS-1 Services**: Preserve seven core services architecture (Auth, AC, Integrity, FV, GS, PGC, EC)
- **Constitutional Governance**: Ensure system functionality throughout remediation
- **Performance Standards**: Enterprise-grade targets maintained

### Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Solana CLI v1.18.22, Anchor v0.29.0, Rust 1.81.0
- **Security Tools**: cargo-audit v0.21.1, cargo-deny v0.17.0, detect-secrets, CodeQL, MSDO
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows, Ubuntu/Windows runners
- **Monitoring**: Task Master CLI, JSON progress tracking

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Unpatched RUSTSEC issues may require breaking changes
2. **Compilation Dependencies**: Rust toolchain compatibility issues
3. **Tool Configuration**: Security scanning tools may need infrastructure updates
4. **Timeline Pressure**: 4-hour critical deadline for blocking issues

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Validation**: Test each fix before proceeding to next task
2. **Rollback Readiness**: Maintain ability to revert changes if issues arise
3. **Parallel Execution**: Run non-dependent tasks simultaneously where possible
4. **Escalation Triggers**: Clear criteria for escalating to senior engineering

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All CRITICAL and HIGH severity CI/CD failures resolved
- [ ] Rust security audit: PASS (zero critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Rust clippy: PASS (zero warnings)
- [ ] Solana Anchor programs: BUILD and TEST successfully
