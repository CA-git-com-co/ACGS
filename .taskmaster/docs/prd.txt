# ACGS-1 Phase 2: Enhanced Policy Synthesis Engine Development - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the remaining implementation tasks for Phase 2 of the ACGS-1 Enhanced Policy Synthesis Engine development. Building upon the successfully completed Phase 1 implementation, Phase 2 focuses on advanced performance optimization, enhanced multi-model integration, production monitoring, security hardening, and comprehensive documentation.

## Project Context

**Current State**: Phase 1 completed with enhanced policy synthesis capabilities, multi-model consensus, constitutional prompting, and adversarial defenses.

**Infrastructure Status**: Redis caching, HAProxy load balancing, Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, and PostgreSQL connection pooling are implemented but require optimization for >1000 concurrent users.

**Security Status**: Basic security hardening completed (88.3/100 security score) with remaining GitHub security alerts and MD5 usage requiring remediation.

## Phase 2 Objectives

### ✅ Priority 1: Advanced Performance Optimization (COMPLETED)
- Enhanced Redis multi-tier caching (L1 + L2) ✅
- Optimized PostgreSQL connection pooling ✅
- Performance validation script created ✅
- Target: >1000 concurrent users, <500ms response times, >99.9% availability

## Remaining Phase 2 Requirements

### Priority 2: Enhanced Multi-Model Integration
**Objective**: Expand multi-model consensus engine to include additional LLM providers for improved constitutional analysis accuracy.

**Requirements**:
- Add DeepSeek Chat v3, DeepSeek R1 via OpenRouter, and Qwen3-235B to consensus engine
- Update services/shared/multi_model_manager.py with new model configurations
- Modify services/shared/langgraph_config.py for additional LLM providers with API key management
- Implement 4+ model consensus capability with weighted voting
- Achieve <2s multi-model response times and >95% consensus accuracy
- Maintain constitutional hash cdd01ef066bc6cf2 validation throughout

### Priority 3: Production Monitoring & Observability
**Objective**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring infrastructure for real-time system health and performance tracking.

**Requirements**:
- Deploy Prometheus metrics collection for all 7 core services (Auth:8000, AC:8001, Integrity:8002, FV:8003, GS:8004, PGC:8005, EC:8006)
- Configure Grafana dashboards for policy synthesis success rates, response times, and system health
- Implement custom constitutional compliance metrics and governance workflow monitoring
- Set up automated alerting for performance degradation and constitutional compliance failures
- Target: <1% monitoring overhead, real-time dashboard updates, automated SLA breach alerts
- Integrate with existing HAProxy load balancer monitoring

### Priority 4: Security Hardening
**Objective**: Achieve production-grade security posture with comprehensive vulnerability remediation.

**Requirements**:
- Audit and resolve remaining GitHub security alerts through dependency updates
- Replace all remaining MD5 cryptographic functions with SHA-256 throughout codebase
- Implement security middleware for API endpoints with rate limiting and input validation
- Deploy automated security scanning with Bandit, safety, and pip-audit integration
- Target: >90% security score, zero HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities, SHA-256 compliance
- Maintain compatibility with existing Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment

### Priority 5: Comprehensive Documentation
**Objective**: Create complete documentation coverage for new features and deployment procedures.

**Requirements**:
- Update API specifications in OpenAPI format for enhanced synthesis endpoints
- Create user guides for multi-model consensus features and monitoring dashboards
- Document performance optimization configurations and deployment procedures
- Generate troubleshooting guides for common issues and error resolution
- Target: Complete API coverage, user guide completeness, deployment runbook accuracy
- Include integration examples and best practices documentation

## Technical Constraints

**Preservation Requirements**:
- Maintain 100% compatibility with existing Quantumagi Solana devnet deployment functionality
- Preserve constitutional hash cdd01ef066bc6cf2 validation throughout all systems
- Ensure all 5 governance workflows remain operational (Policy Creation, Constitutional Compliance, Policy Enforcement, WINA Oversight, Audit/Transparency)
- Maintain <0.01 SOL governance costs for blockchain operations
- Preserve >80% test coverage across unit and integration tests

**Performance Targets**:
- Support >1000 concurrent governance actions
- Maintain <500ms response times for 95% of operations
- Achieve >99.9% system availability
- Ensure <2s multi-model consensus response times
- Maintain >95% constitutional compliance accuracy

**Security Requirements**:
- Achieve >90% security score
- Zero HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- Complete SHA-256 cryptographic compliance
- Comprehensive input validation and rate limiting
- Automated security scanning integration

## Implementation Methodology

**Approach**: Systematic execution with performance validation after each major change
**Rollout**: Incremental implementation with rollback capability for production changes
**Testing**: End-to-end testing after each priority objective completion
**Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking with specific metrics validation
**Documentation**: Continuous documentation updates throughout implementation

## Success Criteria

**Completion Metrics**:
- All 4 remaining priority objectives completed with measurable targets achieved
- Zero regression in existing functionality (Quantumagi, governance workflows, constitutional compliance)
- Performance benchmarks met or exceeded (>1000 concurrent users, <500ms response times, >99.9% availability)
- Security posture improved (>90% security score, zero critical vulnerabilities)
- Complete documentation coverage for new features and configurations

**Validation Requirements**:
- Comprehensive performance testing with load simulation
- Security scanning with automated vulnerability assessment
- End-to-end governance workflow validation
