# ACGS-2 Knowledge Transfer Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information regarding the ACGS-2 system's architecture, compliance, and operational guidelines, as well as performance and security metrics.

### Architectural Diagram
In the ACGS-2 system, the architecture is composed of multiple microservices managed through containerization tools like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

Key components include:
- PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- Redis for caching.
- HAProxy for load balancing.
- OPA for policy enforcement.
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization.

### Key Metrics
- **P99 Latency**: ≤ 5 ms
- **Throughput**: ≥ 100 RPS
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ≥ 85%
- **Compliance Rate**: Exactly 100%

These metrics are vital for maintaining the system's robustness and have been documented in the performance analysis reports.

### Compliance and Security
The system architecture strictly adheres to constitutional principles with a compliance hash integrated throughout the codebase: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`.

Security protocols include:
- JWT security implementations
- RBAC and strong password management
- Comprehensive encryption techniques

### Operational Excellence
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines ensure automated quality assurance and deployment.
- Extensive testing frameworks, including pytest, asyncio, and unittest.
- Performance monitoring with tools like Prometheus to ensure responsiveness and reliability.

## Documentation Roadmap
The following documents are included for in-depth understanding:
- `architecture_overview.md`: Detailed system architecture.
- `ACGS_2_COMPREHENSIVE_MULTIDIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`: Performance, security, and compliance analysis.
- `docker-compose.acgs.yml`: Container configurations for various microservices, highlighting environment setups and dependencies.
