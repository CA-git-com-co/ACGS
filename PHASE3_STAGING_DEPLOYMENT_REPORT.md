# ACGS Phase 3 Staging Deployment Report

**Date:** December 5, 2024  
**Environment:** Staging  
**Deployment Status:** PARTIAL SUCCESS with Critical Issues  
**Overall Health:** 20% (1/5 core services operational)

## Executive Summary

The Phase 3 staging deployment has been partially completed with significant challenges encountered. While the infrastructure components (PostgreSQL, Redis, OPA) are operational and the AC service is running successfully, critical database schema inconsistencies prevent the remaining ACGS services from starting.

## Deployment Progress

### ✅ Successfully Deployed Services

1. **PostgreSQL Database** (Port 5435)
   - Status: ✅ Healthy
   - Configuration: Staging-optimized with 4GB memory limit
   - Performance: Responsive with proper health checks

2. **Redis Cache** (Port 6382)
   - Status: ✅ Healthy
   - Configuration: 2GB memory limit with LRU eviction policy
   - Performance: Operational with proper authentication

3. **OPA Server** (Port 8191)
   - Status: ✅ Healthy
   - Configuration: Latest envoy image with policy support
   - Performance: Ready for policy enforcement

4. **AC Service - Artificial Constitution** (Port 8011)
   - Status: ✅ Healthy
   - Response Time: 5.54ms
   - Health Check: Passing
   - Performance: Meeting <50ms latency requirements

### ❌ Failed Services

1. **Integrity Service** (Port 8012)
   - Status: ❌ Failed - Database Schema Error
   - Issue: Foreign key constraint violation (UUID vs INTEGER mismatch)
   - Impact: Cryptographic verification unavailable

2. **FV Service** (Port 8013)
   - Status: ❌ Disabled - Dependency Issues
   - Issue: Package hash mismatches in requirements.txt
   - Impact: Formal verification unavailable

3. **GS Service** (Port 8014)
   - Status: ❌ Disabled - Dependency Issues
   - Issue: Package hash mismatches in requirements.txt
   - Impact: Governance synthesis unavailable

4. **PGC Service** (Port 8015)
   - Status: ❌ Disabled - Dependency Issues
   - Issue: Package hash mismatches in requirements.txt
   - Impact: Policy compilation unavailable

### ❌ Missing Monitoring Infrastructure

1. **Prometheus** (Port 9090)
   - Status: ❌ Not Deployed
   - Impact: No metrics collection

2. **Grafana** (Port 3002)
   - Status: ❌ Not Deployed
   - Impact: No monitoring dashboards

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Inconsistency (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** The `refresh_tokens` table attempts to create a foreign key constraint referencing `users.id` (UUID) with `user_id` (INTEGER), causing a datatype mismatch.

**Error Details:**
```sql
foreign key constraint "refresh_tokens_user_id_fkey" cannot be implemented
DETAIL: Key columns "user_id" and "id" are of incompatible types: integer and uuid.
```

**Impact:** Prevents Integrity service and dependent services from starting.

**Resolution Required:** Database schema migration to align data types.

### 2. Python Package Hash Mismatches (HIGH)

**Problem:** Several services have requirements.txt files with missing or incorrect package hashes, causing pip installation failures in `--require-hashes` mode.

**Affected Packages:**
- fairlearn==0.10.0
- scikit-learn==1.5.2
- numpy==1.26.4
- pandas==2.2.3
- prometheus_client==0.21.1
- psutil==6.1.0

**Impact:** Prevents FV, GS, and PGC services from building.

**Resolution Required:** Update requirements.txt with correct package hashes or disable hash checking for staging.

### 3. Missing Monitoring Stack (MEDIUM)

**Problem:** Prometheus and Grafana services not included in staging deployment.

**Impact:** No performance monitoring, alerting, or observability.

**Resolution Required:** Add monitoring services to Docker Compose configuration.

## Performance Metrics

### System Resources
- **CPU Usage:** 18.9% ✅ (Good)
- **Memory Usage:** 89.4% ⚠️ (High - requires attention)
- **Disk Usage:** Not measured

### Service Performance
- **AC Service Response Time:** 5.54ms ✅ (Excellent - well under 50ms target)
- **Database Connectivity:** Operational ✅
- **Cache Performance:** Operational ✅

## Security Assessment

### Completed Tests
- **Load Testing:** ✅ Completed successfully
- **Security Testing:** ✅ Completed successfully
- **Penetration Testing:** ⚠️ Results parsing failed

### Security Concerns
- **Database Schema:** Potential data integrity issues
- **Service Authentication:** Limited to operational AC service only
- **Network Security:** Basic Docker network isolation in place

## Recommendations for Production Readiness

### Immediate Actions Required (CRITICAL)

1. **Fix Database Schema**
   - Migrate `refresh_tokens.user_id` to UUID type
   - Ensure all foreign key relationships use consistent data types
   - Test schema migration in staging environment

2. **Resolve Package Dependencies**
   - Generate correct package hashes for all requirements.txt files
   - Consider using pip-tools for hash generation
   - Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline

3. **Complete Service Deployment**
   - Enable FV, GS, and PGC services after dependency resolution
   - Verify inter-service communication
   - Test end-to-end policy synthesis workflow

### Short-term Improvements (HIGH)

1. **Add Monitoring Infrastructure**
   - Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Deploy Grafana for visualization and alerting
   - Configure service discovery and health monitoring

2. **Optimize Resource Usage**
   - Investigate high memory usage (89.4%)
   - Implement resource limits and monitoring
   - Add swap space if needed for staging environment

3. **Enhance Security**
   - Implement comprehensive security scanning
   - Add SSL/TLS termination
   - Configure proper authentication and authorization

### Long-term Enhancements (MEDIUM)

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Implement automated integration tests
   - Add performance regression testing
   - Create automated deployment validation

2. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Implement backup and restore procedures
   - Create disaster recovery documentation
   - Test failover scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Fix** (Priority 1)
   - Create migration script for UUID consistency
   - Test migration in isolated environment
   - Apply migration to staging database

2. **Dependency Resolution** (Priority 2)
   - Regenerate all requirements.txt files with correct hashes
   - Test package installation in clean environment
   - Update Docker build process

3. **Complete Deployment** (Priority 3)
   - Enable remaining ACGS services
   - Deploy monitoring infrastructure
   - Conduct full validation testing

4. **Production Planning** (Priority 4)
   - Address resource optimization
   - Implement security hardening
   - Create production deployment documentation

## Conclusion

The Phase 3 staging deployment demonstrates significant progress with core infrastructure operational and the AC service meeting performance requirements. However, critical database schema issues and dependency management problems prevent full service deployment. 

**Estimated Time to Production Readiness:** 2-3 days with focused effort on database schema migration and dependency resolution.

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM - Core functionality partially operational, but critical services unavailable due to technical debt in database design and dependency management.
