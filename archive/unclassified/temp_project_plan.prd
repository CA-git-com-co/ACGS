# ACGS-PGP Project Implementation Plan

## Task 1: Complete High-Priority Development Items

### 1.1. Enhance LLM Reliability Framework
Description: Enhance LLM Reliability Framework to close the 3.2 percentage point gap (96.8% → 99.9% success rate).
Reference: docs/research/AlphaEvolve-ACGS_Integration_System/llm_reliability_research_protocol.md
Details:
- Focus on addressing the four documented critical failure modes.
- Implement statistical validation to verify improvements.
Priority: High

### 1.2. Complete WINA Runtime Gating Implementation
Description: Complete WINA Runtime Gating Implementation in the GS Engine.
Reference: docs/qec_completion_and_wina_integration_summary.md
Details:
- Replace simulated neuron activations with actual LLM neuron data.
- Verify we achieve the target 40-70% GFLOPs reduction while maintaining >95% accuracy.
Priority: High

### 1.3. Implement Advanced Formal Verification Integration
Description: Implement Advanced Formal Verification Integration.
Reference: docs/research/ACGS-PGP.md
Details:
- Extend our SMT-LIB approach to cover all principle types.
- Integrate verification directly into the policy generation pipeline.
Priority: High

## Task 2: Fix Identified Technical Issues

### 2.1. Resolve Implementation Gaps in src/backend/gs_service/app/core/wina_llm_integration.py
Description: Resolve Implementation Gaps in src/backend/gs_service/app/core/wina_llm_integration.py.
Details:
- Complete the _verify_synthesis_compliance method implementation.
- Replace placeholder neuron activation data with actual LLM neuron activations.
- Enhance model type detection logic beyond simple string matching.
- Fully implement Groq Llama Models integration as documented in docs/GROQ_LLAMA_INTEGRATION.md.
Priority: High

### 2.2. Address Lipschitz Constant Discrepancy
Description: Address Lipschitz Constant Discrepancy.
Reference: docs/research/ACGS-PGP.md Section 4.2.2
Details:
- Update theoretical bounds to align with empirical measurement of L ≈ 0.73.
Priority: Medium

## Task 3: Implement Research Workflow Enhancements

### 3.1. Develop HeterogeneousValidator Class
Description: Develop HeterogeneousValidator Class.
Reference: docs/research/AlphaEvolve-ACGS_Integration_System/llm-enhancement-section.md
Details:
- Implement all four validator types (Primary, Adversarial, Formal, Semantic).
- Create weighted consensus algorithm with configurable thresholds.
Priority: Medium

### 3.2. Enhance Error Handling and Documentation
Description: Enhance Error Handling and Documentation.
Details:
- Follow functional programming principles from our guidelines.
- Create comprehensive performance metrics documentation.
- Implement reproducibility scripts for all key research findings.
Priority: Medium
