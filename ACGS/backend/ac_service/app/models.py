# ACGS/backend/ac_service/app/models.py
# This service uses models from the `shared` directory (e.g., shared.models.Principle).
# This file is kept for structural consistency. If AC Service ever needed its own,
# non-shared database models, they would be defined here.
# For ACGS-PGP Phase 1, Principle model is in `shared/models.py`.

pass # No service-specific models for now
