# SQLAlchemy and psycopg2-binary are inherited from shared,
# but explicitly listing them can be good for clarity or if shared changes.
# For now, assume shared/database.py and shared/models.py handle these.
# Since it uses shared.database.get_async_db, it needs asyncpg.
asyncpg>=0.29.0 
pydantic[email]>=2.6.1,<2.8.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0 # For local .env loading if any (though config usually comes from compose/k8s)

# No other specific dependencies identified for ac_service shell from requirements.
# It primarily uses FastAPI, Pydantic, and shared SQLAlchemy components.
