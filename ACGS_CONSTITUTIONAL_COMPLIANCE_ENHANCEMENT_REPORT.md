## Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Exclusion Patterns
**Objective**: Refine exclusion patterns to include legitimate ACGS-2 documentation while maintaining security

**Changes Made**:
```python
# Before: Broad exclusion of .pytest_cache
"**/.pytest_cache/**"

# After: Selective exclusion allowing ACGS-2 README files
"**/.pytest_cache/**/CACHEDIR.TAG",
"**/.pytest_cache/**/v/**"
```

**Impact**: Allowed inclusion of 2 critical ACGS-2 README files in test cache directories

### 2. Expanded High-Priority Directories
**Objective**: Include additional ACGS-2 project directories in high-priority processing

**Directories Added**:
- `tools/` - ACGS-2 development and operational tools
- `scripts/` - Development and automation scripts
- `reports/` - Project reports and analysis documents
- `reorganization-tools/` - Project reorganization documentation
- `database/` - Database configuration and documentation

**Impact**: 26 additional legitimate ACGS-2 files included in compliance scope

### 3. Enhanced Compliance File Categories
**Objective**: Ensure critical project files are included regardless of location

**Files Added**:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Project change documentation
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policies
- `requirements.txt` - Dependency specifications
- `requirements_dev.txt` - Development dependencies

**Impact**: Improved coverage of project governance and configuration files

### 4. Validation Threshold Enhancement
**Objective**: Raise quality standards for constitutional compliance

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `validate_documentation.py` target from 80% to 85%
- Updated CI/CD workflow default from 80% to 85%
- Enhanced error reporting for compliance violations

**Impact**: Enforced higher standards for ongoing documentation quality
