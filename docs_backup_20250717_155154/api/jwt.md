# JWT Token Reference

<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## 1. Overview

This document provides a reference for the JSON Web Token (JWT) structure used in the ACGS platform for secure authentication and information exchange. JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

## 2. JWT Structure

A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots (`.`):

- **Header**: Contains the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA).
- **Payload**: Contains the claims (statements about an entity, typically the user, and additional data).
- **Signature**: Used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message hasn't been tampered with.

Example Structure:

```
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
```

Where:
- `xxxxx` is the Base64Url encoded Header
- `yyyyy` is the Base64Url encoded Payload
- `zzzzz` is the Signature

## 3. Claims

The payload of a JWT typically contains claims. These can be:

- **Registered claims**: A set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended (e.g., `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject)).
- **Public claims**: Claims defined by JWT users, but to avoid collisions, they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be a URI that contains a collision-resistant namespace.
- **Private claims**: Custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on their meaning.

## 4. Constitutional Compliance

All JWTs issued and validated within the ACGS platform must adhere to the constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`. This ensures that tokens are generated and processed in accordance with the system's security and governance principles.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
All API endpoints require JWT authentication with constitutional context.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" \
     -H "X-Constitutional-Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2" \
     http://localhost:8002/api/v1/endpoint
```

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `GET /health/constitutional` - Constitutional compliance status
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `POST /api/v1/validate` - Constitutional validation

### Response Format
All responses include constitutional metadata:
```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "constitutional_hash": "cdd01ef066bc6cf2",
  "performance_metrics": {
    "response_time_ms": 2.5,
    "cache_hit": true
  }
}
```

- **Documentation Coverage**: Systematic enhancement in progress
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation and improvement

**Overall Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement toward 95% compliance target

## Performance Requirements

### ACGS-2 Performance Targets
- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)  
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection via Prometheus
- Automated alerting on threshold violations
- Continuous validation of constitutional compliance
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD

### Optimization Strategies
- Multi-tier caching implementation
- Database connection pooling with pre-warmed connections
- Request pipeline optimization with async processing
- Constitutional validation caching for sub-millisecond response

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
