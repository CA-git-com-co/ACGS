# Research Materials Extraction Guide
**Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2**

**Constitutional Hash:** `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`

Due to Git repository size constraints, the research materials are stored as compressed archives.

## Extracting Research Papers

To extract the research papers collection:

```bash
cd docs/research
tar -xzf papers_archive.tar.gz
```

This will create a `papers/` directory containing 136 research papers related to:
- Constitutional AI and alignment
- Reward modeling and RLHF
- Preference optimization techniques
- Language model safety and robustness

## Extracting arXiv Paper Images

To extract the images for the arXiv paper (arXiv-2506.16507v1):

```bash
cd docs/research/arXiv-2506.16507v1
tar -xzf images_archive.tar.gz
```

This will restore the PDF figures and charts used in the paper.

## Archive Contents

- `papers_archive.tar.gz`: Complete collection of research papers (136 PDFs)
- `arXiv-2506.16507v1/images_archive.tar.gz`: Paper figures and illustrations

## Size Information

- Papers archive: ~175MB compressed
- Images archive: ~2MB compressed
- Total extracted size: ~600MB

## Automated Extraction

You can also use the provided script:

```bash
./docs/research/extract_all.sh
```

This will extract both archives automatically.

- **Performance Targets**: Meeting P99 <5ms, >100 RPS, >85% cache hit
- **Documentation Coverage**: Systematic enhancement in progress
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation and improvement

**Overall Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement toward 95% compliance target

## Performance Requirements

### ACGS-2 Performance Targets
- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)  
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection via Prometheus
- Automated alerting on threshold violations
- Continuous validation of constitutional compliance
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD

### Optimization Strategies
- Multi-tier caching implementation
- Database connection pooling with pre-warmed connections
- Request pipeline optimization with async processing
- Constitutional validation caching for sub-millisecond response

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
