### 3. Architecture Components Captured

#### Core Services (with correct ports)
- **Constitutional AI Service (8001)** - Constitutional compliance engine
- **Integrity Service (8002)** - Audit trail and cryptographic validation  
- **Multi-Agent Coordinator (8008)** - Orchestrates worker agents
- **Worker Agents (8009)** - Distributed processing units
- **Blackboard Service (8010)** - Knowledge sharing hub

#### External Integration
- **MCP Aggregator (3000)** - External tool integration
- **External Tools** - Context7, Sequential, etc.
- **Client/Gateway** - External interface

#### Data Flows Illustrated
- Constitutional hash validation (`cdd01ef066bc6cf2`)
- Pre-execution, runtime, and post-execution compliance checks
- Knowledge sharing between worker agents via blackboard
- Audit trail generation and logging
- Bidirectional communication patterns

### 4. Constitutional Compliance Features
✅ **Hash Validation Flows** - Constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` validation across all services
✅ **Compliance Checking** - Pre-execution, runtime, and post-execution checks
✅ **Audit Trail** - Complete audit database integration
✅ **Multi-Stage Validation** - Compliance reports from all worker agents

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `figures/production_architecture.mmd` - Mermaid source
2. `figures/production_architecture.tikz` - TikZ source  
3. `figures/production_architecture.svg` - SVG render
4. `figures/production_architecture.pdf` - PDF render
5. `figures/render_matplotlib.py` - Python rendering script

### Files Modified:
1. `main.tex` - Updated figure reference and caption

## Technical Details

### Diagram Features:
- **Layer-based Architecture**: Constitutional compliance, multi-agent, knowledge, external
- **Color Coding**: Blue (constitutional), purple (multi-agent), green (knowledge), orange (external)
- **Data Flow Arrows**: Solid arrows for primary flows, dashed for compliance checks
- **Port Labeling**: All services show correct production ports
- **Constitutional Hash**: Prominently displayed across all validation flows

### Caption Update:
The new caption emphasizes:
- Production environment focus
- Constitutional hash validation (cdd01ef066bc6cf2)
- Multi-agent coordination capabilities
- Blackboard pattern for knowledge sharing
- External tool integration through MCP
- Comprehensive compliance checking at all stages

## Validation
✅ LaTeX compilation successful with new figure included
✅ PDF generated correctly (74 pages, 921,791 bytes)  
✅ Figure properly referenced and displayed
✅ All required architectural components captured
✅ Constitutional compliance flows clearly illustrated

## Summary
The task has been completed successfully. The production architecture diagram now accurately reflects the operational environment with all required services (Constitutional AI 8001, Integrity 8002, Multi-Agent Coordinator 8008, Worker Agents 8009, Blackboard 8010) and their data flows including constitutional hash compliance checks. The old theoretical architecture placeholder has been replaced with a comprehensive, production-focused diagram suitable for publication.

- **Documentation Coverage**: Systematic enhancement in progress
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation and improvement

**Overall Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement toward 95% compliance target

## Performance Requirements

### ACGS-2 Performance Targets
- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)  
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection via Prometheus
- Automated alerting on threshold violations
- Continuous validation of constitutional compliance
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD

### Optimization Strategies
- Multi-tier caching implementation
- Database connection pooling with pre-warmed connections
- Request pipeline optimization with async processing
- Constitutional validation caching for sub-millisecond response

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
