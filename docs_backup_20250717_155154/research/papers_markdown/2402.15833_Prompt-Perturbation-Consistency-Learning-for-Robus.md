Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have demon-

strated impressive performance on a number of

natural language processing tasks, such as ques-

tion answering and text summarization. How-

ever, their performance on sequence labeling

tasks, such as intent classification and slot fill-

ing (IC-SF), which is a central component in

personal assistant systems, lags significantly

behind discriminative models. Furthermore,

there is a lack of substantive research on ro-

bustness of LLMs to various perturbations in

the input prompts. The contributions of this

paper are three-fold. First, we show that fine-

tuning sufficiently large LLMs can produce IC-

SF performance comparable to discriminative

models. Next, we systematically analyze the

performance deterioration of those fine-tuned

models due to three distinct yet relevant types

of input perturbations - oronyms, synonyms,

and paraphrasing. Finally, we propose an ef-

ficient mitigation approach, prompt perturba-

tion consistency learning (PPCL), which works

by regularizing the divergence between losses

from clean and perturbed samples. Our ex-

periments show that PPCL can recover on an

average 59% and 69% of the performance drop

for IC and SF tasks, respectively. Furthermore,

PPCL beats data augmentation approach while

using ten times fewer augmented data samples.

Introduction

Voice controlled smart personal assistants like

Amazon Echo and Google Home have flourished

in recent years, enabling goal-oriented conversa-

tions and aiding tasks like setting reminders, check-

ing weather, controlling smart devices, and online

shopping. A core capability of those systems is to

perform accurate and robust intent classification

(IC) and slot filling (SF) (Tur and De Mori, 2011;

Qin et al., 2021). The IC task involves identifying

the speaker’s desired intent from a given utterance,

∗This work was done while interning at Amazon.

while the SF task involves recognizing the key ar-

guments of the intent. For instance, given a user

query “wake me up at five am this week.", the in-

tent is ‘set alarm’, while the SF component should

identify the specific details, such as ‘five am’ as

time and ‘this week’ as date for the alarm setting.

Pre-trained LLMs hold promise of greatly im-

proving personal assistant systems, owing to their

impressive conversational and reasoning capabili-

ties. In addition to generating fluent conversations,

LLMs have shown SOTA performance on a variety

of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as

text classification, question answering, text summa-

rization (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023).

Furthermore, some LLMs have shown promising

ability to generate structured outputs such as code

synthesis (Nijkamp et al., 2023) and API calls (Patil

et al., 2023). However, the performance of LLMs

on other structured prediction tasks such as slot

filling lags significantly behind.

Another important issue is that LLMs can be

highly sensitive to prompt variations (Webson and

Pavlick, 2022; Min et al., 2022; Ye and Durrett,

2022). For instance, varying the order of few-shot

examples, introducing minor typos or different ex-

pressions with the same semantic meaning can lead

to qualitatively different results (Jin et al., 2020;

Li et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Zhuo et al.,

2023). In conversational systems, such perturba-

tions might be caused by automatic speech recogni-

tion (ASR) errors, linguistic differences, and user-

specific expressions. Thus, adopting LLMs for

voice-based personal assistants requires a good un-

derstanding of their robustness to above types of

perturbations, and effective mitigation to have ro-

bust LLM-based IC-SF models.

In this paper we mainly consider the following

questions: (1) How can we close the performance

gap between LLMs and SOTA discriminative mod-

els on IC-SF tasks? (2) How does the performance

of LLMs change due to minor changes in the origi-

nal utterances? (3) Can we improve the robustness

of LLMs in the cases of realistic perturbations?

To address the first question, we explore super-

vised fine-tuning (SFT) for the IC-SF task, where

the base LLM is asked to generate a target output

based on an input query. We conduct extensive ex-

periments on three publicly available NLU bench-

mark datasets (ATIS, SNIPS, MASSIVE) and show

that by combining prompt selection and SFT on

moderately sized datasets, LLMs can learn to gen-

erate structured IC-SF hypotheses with accuracy

that is on par with SOTA discriminative method.

Next, we analyze the robustness of the fine-tuned

models to three different types of input perturba-

tions that are relevant in the context of voice assis-

tant systems – oronyms, synonyms, and paraphras-

ing. We find that all three types of perturbations

negatively impact the model performance, resulting

in a significant performance drop on IC-SF tasks.

Finally, we propose a novel framework that we

call prompt perturbation consistency learning, or

PPCL, to improve the robustness of LLMs against

perturbations. Our framework (1) generates per-

turbed counterparts given the original utterance

by either replacing a small subset of tokens or

paraphrasing the utterance while constraining the

semantic similarity, (2) fine-tunes LLMs with an

additional consistency regularization term in the

objective which explicitly encourages the model

to generate consistent predictions for the original

utterance and its perturbed counterpart. We con-

duct extensive experiments and demonstrate that

PPCL can recover on an average 59% and 69%

of the dropped performance for IC and SF tasks

against perturbations, respectively. Furthermore,

our results indicate that PPCL outperforms simple

data augmentation approach while using only 10%

of augmented dataset.

Related Work

Intent Classification and Slot Filling

Various

techniques have been explored for intent classi-

fication(Sarikaya et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012;

Ravuri and Stolcke, 2015), with recent work focus-

ing on transformer-based models and transfer learn-

ing with pre-trained language models (Qin et al.,

2021). Slot filling, on the other hand, is typically

approached using sequence labeling models, such

as conditional random fields (CRFs), bidirectional

LSTMs, and transformer-based architectures (Weld

et al., 2022a; Chen et al., 2019; Goo et al., 2018;

He and Garner, 2023). For a recent survey of joint

IC-SF methods, see (Weld et al., 2022b)

Data Augmentation

In NLP tasks, data augmen-

tation methods have been explored to generate

new instances by manipulating a few words in

the original text (Feng et al., 2021; Chen et al.,

2023). Some common techniques include word

replacement, random deletion, and word position

swap (Wei and Zou, 2019). Additionally, data aug-

mentation in NLP can involve creating entirely ar-

tificial examples using back-translation (Sennrich

et al., 2015) or generative models like variational

auto-encoders (Malandrakis et al., 2019; Yoo et al.,

2019). Data augmentation has also become popular

for NER tasks and has been shown to be effective

strategy for boosting model performance (Dai and

Adel, 2020; Meng et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021).

Consistency

Training

Consistency

training

methods aim to improve the robustness of models

by enforcing the stability of their predictions

under small perturbations, such as random noise,

adversarial noise, or data augmentation techniques,

applied to input examples or hidden states. Several

attempts have been made to implement consistency

training in NER tasks, utilizing both token-level

and sequence-level approaches.

Token-level

consistency involves regularizing the model to

remain unaffected by Gaussian noise (Lowell et al.,

2020) or word replacement, operating at the same

granularity as NER (Dai and Adel, 2020; Liu et al.,

2022). However, using such simplistic noise or

augmentation methods may violate the assumption

that the noised tokens should retain the same labels

as the original tokens. Alternatively, a sequence-

level consistency method employs high-quality

augmentation, like back-translation, to enhance

consistency across the entire sentence (Xie et al.,

2020). Nonetheless, this approach overlooks the

precise location of entities due to word alignment

issues, leading to a sub-optimal design.

More

recently, ConNER has been proposed to foster

consistent predictions between a span of tokens

in the original sentence and their corresponding

projection in a translated sentence (Zhou et al.,

2022). Unfortunately, ConNER’s applicability is

confined to cross-lingual NER tasks. Consistency

training for fine-tuning LLMs on IC-SF tasks has

not been thoroughly explored yet.

Method

3.1

Problem Formulation

Our main objective is to utilize LLMs for the pur-

pose of generating structured hypotheses. As illus-

trated in Figure 1, LLMs are expected to generate

correct, coherent, and structured responses, includ-

ing domain, intent, and slot labels, based on user

utterances. To fill the performance gap between

LLMs and SOTA discriminative models, we apply

instruction fine-tuning (Touvron et al., 2023).

We decompose our task into five steps: (1)

Prompts Construction: we design several prompt

structures, outlined in Appendix Table 1, to be em-

ployed during our instruction fine-tuning process.

These prompts utilize the input utterances X and

the target outputs Y , which encompass various la-

bels such as Ydomain, Yintent, and Yslots; (2) Instruc-

tion Fine-tuning: during instruction fine-tuning, we

utilize both the input (X) and output (Y ) within the

prompt structure, denoted as Prompt(X, Y ). This

approach assists LLMs in learning the task of pre-

dicting structured hypotheses, specifically focusing

on tasks like IC-SF within our investigation; (3) Re-

sponse Generation: subsequent to instruction fine-

tuning, we employ prompts with only input data,

referred to as Prompt(X), to elicit responses from

the LLMs. These responses manifest as a generated

text sequence, denoted as W = {w1, · · · , wn};

(4) Obtaining Structured Hypotheses: the gener-

ated text sequence W is then transformed into

structured hypotheses, culminating in the final

outcomes denoted as { ˆYdomain, ˆYintent, ˆYslots}; (5)

Performance Evaluation:

we evaluate the per-

formance by comparing the ground truth labels

{Ydomain, Yintent, Yslots} with the outputs from the

LLMs { ˆYdomain, ˆYintent, ˆYslots}. Various metrics

are employed for this evaluation, e.g., accuracy and

F1-score for IC and SF, respectively.

LLMs exhibit vulnerability to perturbations

(Zhuo et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023), leading to

the generation of incorrect responses, as demon-

strated in Figure 1. Introducing small perturba-

tions to the inputs X or expressing them differ-

ently while preserving the same meaning would

result in distinct inputs denoted as X′. Neverthe-

less, given that X′ maintains identical structured

hypotheses and target labels Y , our expectation is

that LLMs should be able to generate correct re-

sponses. In other words, LLMs are expected to

be robust against these perturbations and generate

consistent responses.

3.2

Prompts Construction

The standard prompts employed during instruction

fine-tuning process with LLMs typically involve

presenting both the input context and its corre-

sponding target output in a paired structure (Liu

et al., 2023). The LLMs are then trained to generate

the target output based on the input context. The

primary objective here is to fine-tune the models’

parameters aiming to minimize prediction errors

and improve their ability to generate accurate and

contextually appropriate responses.

We construct several prompt formats for IC-SF

tasks as detailed in Appendix Table 1. The simple

prompt format involves presenting the utterance

and target outputs consecutively. Next, we design a

structured prompt format that for predicting struc-

tured hypotheses. As shown in Appendix Table

1, this format associates the intent with its corre-

sponding domain and aligns the slot labels with the

arguments of the request.

Furthermore, in the context of the sequence la-

beling task, i.e., SF, it is expected that LLMs gen-

erate slot labels for each individual token within

the given utterance. Effectively associating tokens

with their respective slot labels is crucial to en-

hance the models’ performance during instruction

fine-tuning. Therefore, we construct three different

SF prompt formats with the intention of improving

model proficiency in the SF task. The tag-only for-

## Page 4

mat represents the simplest approach, but it is more

challenging since the model is required to implic-

itly track token indices as well (Raman et al., 2022).

To simplify, we introduce sentinel-based formats.

These sentinel markers enable us to avoid redun-

dant inclusion of the original tokens in the target

output. Instead, the sentinel tokens are employed

to facilitate the learning of associations between

tokens and their corresponding slot labels.

Our constructed prompt formats offer several

advantages: (1) The structured format efficiently

arranges the input and output labels within a co-

herent structure, facilitating the generation of struc-

tured hypotheses; (2) The sentinel-based formats

eliminate the need for redundant input repetition,

simplifying the decoding process and preventing

hallucinations; (3) These formats enable a more

straightforward method for token tracking (includ-

ing indices) and establishing connections between

tokens and their corresponding slot labels.

3.3

Perturbations

A robust model aims to convert all utterances with

or without meaning-preserving perturbations into

correct hypotheses. To evaluate model robustness

in IC-SF tasks, we employ different types of per-

turbations: oronyms, synonyms, and paraphrases,

covering both word-level and sentence-level pertur-

bations aligned with real-world application scenar-

ios. We show some examples of these perturbations

in Appendix Table 8 and present more details of

the generation process in Section 4.3.

Oronym perturbation involves making changes

to a text by replacing words or phrases with those

that are phonetically similar but carry a different

meaning. Oronym perturbation is widely used for

data augmentation in NLP tasks, especially for

tasks that require robustness to speech recognition

errors (ASR) or homophonic ambiguity (Cai et al.,

2023). While the altered semantics of oronym-

perturbed expressions may differ from the initial

utterances, our expectation is that LLMs should

exhibit robustness to these changes and produce

responses aligned with user intent.

Synonym perturbation replaces certain words or

phrases with their synonyms while preserving the

overall meaning of the text. It is commonly em-

ployed in NLP as data augmentation to enhance

data diversity by generating new variations of a

given sentence while retaining semantic coherence

(Alfonso-Hermelo et al., 2021). Synonym perturba-

tion tests robustness of LLMs in generating consis-

tent hypotheses when presented with semantically

similar utterances.

Paraphrasing perturbation entails rephrasing a

given text to create variations while preserving its

original meaning. This is highly consistent with

our daily communications that present the same

meaning in different ways. Hence, irrespective

of the chosen words or structures, LLMs should

consistently produce accurate hypotheses.

3.4

Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is widely used in fine-tuning

LLMs to improve their generalization capabilities.

There are two major benefits of data augmentation:

(1) It expands the dataset, which proves beneficial

for overcoming limited training data in diverse real-

world scenarios; (2) It diversifies the fine-tuning

dataset, equipping the model to better handle lin-

guistic variations and consequently enhancing its

performance in downstream tasks.

We apply a range of data augmentation tech-

niques, each designed to generate diverse data

through specific perturbations. To elaborate, we

utilize word replacement techniques involving

oronyms and synonyms as forms of data augmen-

tation. This approach improves LLM’s ability to

adapt to previously unseen data and comprehend

language variations, addressing the challenges as-

sociated with speech recognition and linguistic am-

biguity. We also paraphrase the training data, pro-

viding LLMs with more examples to learn different

ways of expressing the same content.

However, even though data augmentation is ad-

vantageous, it is essential not to introduce noise or

potentially misleading content. We establish spe-

cific constraints during the generation process and

implement post-processing filters to reinforce the

preservation of the original utterances’ integrity.

3.5

Prompt Perturbation Consistency

Learning (PPCL)

Despite the fact that data augmentation has been

demonstrated to be efficient to improve model ro-

bustness and generalizability (Chen et al., 2021), it

overlooks the similar semantic meaning shared be-

tween the original and augmented data. To address

this, we propose perturbation consistency learn-

ing framework to further utilize these augmented

data, particularly the perturbed counterparts of the

original utterances in our study. The key idea is

to integrate a term into the training objective that

explicitly encourages the generation of similar pre-

respectively. ˆyc and ˆyp here denote the slot labels gener-

dictions (and consequently, comparable responses)

for both the original utterance and its perturbed

counterpart. Through the incorporation of this ad-

ditional constraint, our goal is to strengthen the

model’s ability to maintain consistency between the

original and perturbed utterances, resulting in im-

proved robustness and more reliable performance

across real-world applications.

Our objective is to align the model’s responses

when presented with two semantically equivalent

utterances. To achieve this, we add an extra com-

ponent into the training objective: the Jensen-

Shannon (JS) divergence of output probabilities

between a clean utterance and its perturbed coun-

terpart. This term is integrated with the standard

cross-entropy loss utilized in the auto-regression

phase of the fine-tuning process.

Figure 2 shows the architecture of PPCL. During

the fine-tuning process, we simultaneously input

the clean utterance denoted as xc and its perturbed

counterpart labeled as xp to the LLMs. In response

to these inputs, the LLMs generate correspond-

ing outputs pj

c and pj

p, respectively, the probabil-

ity distributions over vocabulary of the j-th out-

put token for xc and xp, where pj

c, pj

p ∈R|V| and

V denotes the vocabulary size. Subsequently, we

apply Softmax to pj

c and pj

p and get their respec-

tive probability distributions ˆyj

c and ˆyj

p, formally:

ˆyj

c = Softmax(pj

c) and ˆyj

p = Softmax(pj

p). We

then apply JS divergence to quantify the similarity

between ˆyj

c and ˆyj

p. JS is a symmetric variation of

Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL), defined as:

JS(ˆyj

c||ˆyj

p) = 1

2(KL(ˆyj

c||ˆyj

m)+KL(ˆyj

p||ˆyj

m)), (1)

where ˆyj

m = 1

2(ˆyj

c + ˆyj

p). JS smooths out the asym-

metry of KL and offers a more balanced perspec-

tive on similarity. We obtain the JS of the two

probability distributions of j-th output, denoted as:

JS(ˆyj

c || ˆyj

p). We use the average JS across all out-

put probability distributions associated with xc and

xp as our final perturbation consistency learning

loss, formally:

## Ljs = 1

## L

## L

## X

j=1

JS(ˆyj

c || ˆyj

p),

(2)

where L denotes the response length.

Utilizing Eq. 2 with oronym and synonym per-

turbations is straightforward, as these perturbations

merely substitute tokens or phrases with their re-

spective oronyms and synonyms while maintaining

the utterance length. However, paraphrasing pertur-

bations lead to varying lengths between the clean

utterance and its modified counterpart. Instead of

computing the JS for each token-pair in the output,

we employ the averaged probability distribution to

calculate the perturbation consistency learning loss

for paraphrasing perturbations, formally:

LJS = JS(ˆyc || ˆyp),

(3)

3.6

Training Objective

Our training objective integrates the supervised

cross-entropy losses for both clean and perturbed

utterances (i.e., LC and LP ) with the perturbation

consistency learning loss LJS, formally:

LC = CE(ˆyc, y),

(4)

LP = CE(ˆyp, y),

(5)

L = λ1LC + λ2LP + λ3LJS,

(6)

where λ1, λ2, and λ3 are weight coefficients.

In order to optimize the above objective, it is es-

sential to have both the clean utterance and its corre-

sponding perturbed counterpart. We generate these

paired perturbed utterances using our proposed per-

turbation generation methods.

Furthermore, to

ensure the presence of semantically comparable

pairs, we implement specific post-processing filter-

ing procedures. These filters serve to verify that the

generated perturbed utterances genuinely maintain

semantic equivalence with their clean counterparts.

Experimental Settings

## Page 6

Datasets

We evaluate model performance on

three NLU benchmark datasets, i.e., ATIS (Price,

1990), SNIPS (Coucke et al., 2018), MASSIVE

(FitzGerald et al., 2022). More details of these

datasets and their statistics are shown in the Ap-

pendix.

Prompt Formats

We show our proposed prompt

formats with an illustrated example for IC-SF tasks

in Table 1.

Baselines

We compare the performance of PPCL

with the following baselines:

supervised fine-

tuning with discriminative models like JointBERT

and JointBERT+CRF, zero-shot and few-shot learn-

ing with GPT variants, instruction fine-tuning with

LLaMA. For additional information about these

baselines and their specific experimental setups,

please refer to the Appendix.

4.2

Evaluation Metrics

For the IC task, we use prediction accuracy on a

held-out test set, and for the SF task, we use the

F1-score as the evaluation metrics. Instead of us-

ing absolute differences in performance between

models trained with clean and perturbed data, we

use a relative measurement. We introduce Perfor-

mance Drop Rate (PDR), which quantifies the rela-

tive performance decline following a perturbation,

formally:

PDR(D, D′, fθ) = 1 −

## P

(x,y)∈D′ M[fθ(x), y]

## P

(x,y)∈D M[fθ(x), y] .

(7)

M here is the indicator function and fθ denotes the

models. D and D′ indicates the clean and perturbed

test sets, respectively. We want to clarify that the

clean and perturbed test sets are in a one-to-one

correspondence, thus |D| == |D′|. In other words,

each example in the clean test set has a correspond-

ing example in the perturbed test set. This ensures

a fair and direct comparison between the model’s

performance on clean and perturbed samples.

4.3

Perturbed Evaluation Sets

We generate perturbed evaluation sets for each

benchmark dataset. The synonym perturbation in-

volves randomly choosing and substituting words

with their synonyms based on the WordNet syn-

onym corpus. The oronym perturbation follows a

similar procedure relying on the NLTK pronounc-

ing corpus. Specifically, we compile a list of key

stop words based on the domain, intent, and slot

label sets, and do not substitute them. Addition-

ally, we have imposed a limit of three words as the

maximum number that can be perturbed in an ut-

terance to prevent significant changes in semantic

meaning. We generate the paraphrases using a spe-

cific LLM from Huggingface, which is specially

pre-trained for generating high-quality paraphrases.

To further ensure that clean and perturbed samples

are semantically similar, we filter out perturbations

with BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) with the orig-

inal sample. We use a 0.85 threshold based on our

empirical experimental studies.

With perturbations of samples, generating appro-

priate target labels is crucial for evaluation. For

intent labels, we align them with those of the orig-

inal utterances. For slot labels, the procedure is

more complex. For perturbations that maintain the

length and word order, such as oronyms and syn-

onyms, we directly adopt the original slot labels as

their corresponding counterparts. For paraphrased

variations that may deviate in length and word or-

der from the original utterance, we automatically

generate new slot labels. The new slot labels are

derived from the semantic annotations present in

the original utterance. This strategy ensures that

the perturbed versions retain their intended mean-

ing while accommodating any structural changes

arising from the paraphrasing process.

Results and Discussion

5.1

Performance Gap between LLMs and

discriminative models

First, we show the model performance compari-

son of different baselines on three datasets in Ta-

ble 2. These results demonstrate that LLMs, i.e.,

GPT2 and LLaMA, which have been instruction

fine-tuned with our proposed sentinel-based struc-

tured format, achieve comparable intent classifica-

tion performance to SOTA discriminative models

like JointBERT across all three datasets. However,

applying zero-shot and few-shot learning settings

the performance of LLMs is notably worse, espe-

cially for the SF tasks.

The lower performance of LLMs on the SF task

could be attributed to the mismatch between the

nature of the semantic labeling task and the design

of text generation models. The latter are not in-

herently optimized for SF tasks, which might lead

to sub-optimal results in some cases. However

they can still achieve comparable results for the

sequence labeling task, such as SF, after supervised

fine-tuning with appropriate instructions or struc-

tured formats. This is demonstrated by LLaMA-

30b achieving and average SF accuracy (89.84%)

within 1.3% of JointBERT performance (91.03%),

and even superseding it for MASSIVE dataset.

It is important to highlight that the key advan-

tage of using generative models over discrimina-

tive models for IC-SF tasks lies in their ability to

create and understand a wider range of linguistic

variations. Generative models can generate new

examples, enhancing the training set with diverse

phrases and structures. This leads to a more robust

model that can better handle varied user inputs. In

contrast, discriminative models typically rely on

the existing training set, which might limit their

ability to adapt to new or unexpected ways people

express similar intents.

Prompt Formats

We compare the model performance using differ-

ent prompt formats in Table 3. The sentinel-based

structured prompt format achieves the best perfor-

mance, particularly for the SF tasks. This outcome

aligns with our initial hypothesis that the structured

format is highly effective in organizing both the in-

put and output labels, leading to improved learning

ability for the models. In addition, sentinel-based

slot formatting significantly improves performance.

Performance Drop due to Prompt

Perturbations

Table 6 illustrates examples of clean and perturbed

utterances and their difference in model predictions

even though the BertScores between the clean and

perturbed samples are higher than 0.85. We show

the relative performance drops resulting from the

following three perturbations: oronyms, synonyms,

and paraphrases, on MASSIVE dataset in Table 4.

The results of ATIS and SNIPS are shown in Ap-

pendix. Results show that discriminative models,

ICL approaches, and LLMs with instruction fine-

tuning are vulnerable to these perturbations with

large performance drops, most notably, in SF tasks

with oronym perturbations.

These findings highlight the vulnerabilities of

both discriminative and generative models when

exposed to perturbed data, emphasizing the need to

improve model robustness for real-world applica-

tions. Identifying and mitigating the impact of per-

turbations, especially in tasks involving sequence

labeling like SF, are critical to improving the per-

formance and generalizability of these models.

5.4

PPCL Mitigation Results

We share results from two mitigation approaches

for improving robustness of LLMs against prompt

perturbations: data augmentation and PPCL. We

show results with different augmentation sizes and

different combinations of loss functions on MAS-

SIVE dataset are in Table 5. All these are done on

LLaMA-7b model. Both approaches decrease the

significant performance drop. The ones where mul-

tiple perturbed samples are added for each clean

sample the training data size increases by 50k or

more. For example, data augmentation with one

perturbed sample per clean sample, along with per-

turbation loss, shown as LC + LP recovers perfor-

mance drops up to 45% on IC and 51% on SF tasks,

respectively for Oronym perturbation. When aug-

mented with 5 perturbed samples per clean sample,

it performs better. However, PPCL, with only 1 per-

turbed sample per clean, which includes perturba-

tion loss and JS loss, outperforms multiple sample

augmentation in all cases, except for SF in para-

phrase perturbation. For paraphrase perturbation,

PPCL recovers 60% of SF-PDR compared to 74%

by multi-sample augmentation, but at one-tenth the

augmentation size. On average, PPCL is able to

recover 59% in IC and 69% in SF performance

drops. In comparison, multi-sample augmentation

is able to recover 58% in IC and 59% in SF. PPCL

achieves the recoveries with one-tenth the augmen-

indicating the generalizability and effectiveness of

our approach across different domains and datasets.

5.5

Ablation Studies

In our training objective, there are three different

terms in Eq. 6, and to better understand their contri-

butions towards improving the robustness of LLMs

against perturbations, we conducted an ablation

study as shown in Table 5. Experimental results

make it clear that the models achieve the best per-

formance when all three loss terms (Lc, Lp, Ljs)

in the training objective are utilized, indicating each

term plays a significant role in enhancing the ro-

bustness of the models. PPCL outperforms multi-

sample augmentation with a fraction of augmenta-

tion volume in 5 out of 6 tasks in Massive data.

We have also carefully fine-tuned the three

weights in the PPCL loss (Eq. 6) for each dataset

respectively to identify the best-performing model.

To improve model performance, we believe that

these weights should be carefully fine-tuned and

selected under different settings and datasets.

5.6

Failure and Saved Examples

We provide two case studies in Table 6 to illustrate

some failure due to the perturbations and the recov-

eries after applying PPCL. In these two examples,

we observe that oronym substitution and paraphras-

ing lead the model to generate incorrect responses.

These incorrect responses (red lines) are charac-

terized as failure cases, as they do not accurately

capture the user’s intents or the relevant informa-

tion in the utterances. However, after re-training

the model with PPCL, we see improvement. The

model is now able to generate the correct responses,

which are demonstrated in blue lines.

Conclusion

We study, evaluate, and improve the robustness of

LLMs in generating structured hypotheses, such

as IC-SF tasks. We first propose a sentinel-based

structured prompt format for instruction fine-tuning

LLMs resulting in comparable performance to

SOTA discriminative models. Next, we evaluate

robustness of LLMs under various prompt pertur-

bations, i.e., synonyms, oronyms, and paraphrases.

Our results indicate that LLMs are vulnerable to

these perturbations, with an average performance

drop rate of 13.07% in IC accuracy and 22.20%

in SF F1-score. We then propose two mitigation

strategies, i.e., perturbation consistency learning

and data augmentation, aiming to improve model

robustness.

These methods can recover up to

59% performance drop in IC task and 69% in SF

task, making the resulting LLMs more robust to

prompt perturbations. Finally, our findings show

that PPCL surpasses the basic data augmentation

method, achieving superior performance with just

10% of the augmented datasets, thereby exhibiting

enhanced scalability.

Limitations

PPCL was developed based on observations on pub-

licly available small datasets like Massive, ATIS,

SNIPS. The improvement in performance might

not be as pronounced in real world datasets whose

distributions and noise structure might not mimic

the public datasets. Improvement in robustness by

implementing PPCL was evaluated on IC-SF tasks.

We expect PPCL to work in other tasks as well, but

we have not demonstrated it. We plan to do so in

future work.

Ethics Statement

The authors foresee no ethical concerns with the re-

search presented in this work. They also completed

an internal legal review process which verified that

we are using publicly available models and datasets

consistent with their intended use.

Datasets

We show the data statistics of the three datasets in

Table 7 and present more details here.

ATIS: ATIS dataset has been widely used to de-

velop and evaluate natural language understanding

systems, including intent detection, slot-filling, and

dialogue act classification. The dataset consists of

a collection of human-computer dialogues, where

users interact with a simulated airline information

system to obtain various travel-related information,

such as flight schedules, ticket availability, and air-

port information. These dialogues were collected

from real users interacting with the ATIS system.

SNIPS: SNIPS dataset is designed to support the

development and evaluation of voice-controlled

systems for home automation tasks. It consists of

a large collection of spoken language interactions,

where users interact with a voice assistant to per-

form various tasks commonly found in a home set-

ting, such as setting alarms, playing music, check-

ing the weather, and controlling smart devices.

MASSIVE: MASSIVE dataset is an open source

multilingual NLU dataset from Amazon Alexa

NLU systems consisting of 1 million labeled utter-

ances spanning 51 language. For our experiments,

we only use the en-US domain utterances.

## A.2

Baselines

JointBERT and JointBERT+CRF: JointBERT

was propose in (Chen et al., 2019) as a joint IC-SF

model based on BERT. JointBERT+CRF investi-

gates the efficacy of adding Conditional Random

Field (CRF) for modeling slot label dependencies

on top of the joint BERT model. We use English

uncased BERT-Base model which has 12 layers,

768 hidden states, and 12 heads. For fine-tuning,

all hyper-parameters are tuned on the development

set. The maximum length is 50. The batch size is

32. Adam is used for optimization with an initial

learning rate of 5e-5. The dropout probability is

0.1. The maximum number of epochs is set as 10.

Zero/Few-shot Learning: In our experiments, we

utilize the OpenAI API and GPT3.5 for conduct-

ing zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks. We use

10 examples in the few-shot learning. Different

prompts are designed to evaluate the model’s abil-

ity to generalize and perform tasks it hasn’t been

explicitly trained on, showcasing its capacity for

zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios.

LLMs: We evaluate several popular LLMs, includ-

ing GPT-2 and LLaMA. GPT-2 is a large-scale

unsupervised language model designed to generate

human-like text based on the context given to it.

We use the smallerst version of GPT-2 with 124M

parameters. The LLaMA model is a collection of

foundation language models ranging from 7B to

65B parameters proposed by Meta. We use the 7b,

13b, and 30b versions during our experiments.

Supervised Fine-tuning: We first apply supervised

fine-tuning with LLMs for IC-SF tasks. The max-

imum length is set as 256. The batch size is 32.

Adam is also use for optimization with an initial

learning rate of 3e-4 with 100 steps warm-up. We

fine-tune the model 5 ecpochs.

Perturbation Consistency Learning: We further

fine-tune the models for another 2 epochs with out

perturbation consistency learning objective. We

use Adam as optimizer with an initial learning rate

of 3e-4.
