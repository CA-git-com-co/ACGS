Abstract

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary method

for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. The RLHF process typically

starts by training a reward model (RM) using human preference data.

Conventional RMs

are trained on pairwise responses to the same user request, with relative ratings indicating

which response humans prefer.

The trained RM serves as a proxy for human preferences.

However, due to the black-box nature of RMs, their outputs lack interpretability, as humans

cannot intuitively understand why an RM thinks a response is good or not. As RMs act as

human preference proxies, it is desirable for them to be human-interpretable to ensure that

their internal decision processes are consistent with human preferences and to prevent reward

hacking in LLM alignment. To build RMs with interpretable preferences, we propose a two-

stage approach: i) train an Absolute-Rating Multi-Objective Reward Model (ArmoRM) with

multi-dimensional absolute-rating data, each dimension corresponding to a human-interpretable

objective (e.g., honesty, verbosity, safety); ii) employ a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) strategy with

a gating network that automatically selects the most suitable reward objectives based on the

context. We efficiently trained an ArmoRM with Llama-3 8B and a gating network consisting

of a shallow MLP on top of the ArmoRM. Our trained model, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B, obtains state-

of-the-art performance on RewardBench, a benchmark evaluating RMs for language modeling.

Notably, the performance of our model surpasses the LLM-as-a-judge method with GPT-4

judges by a margin, and approaches the performance of the much larger Nemotron-4 340B

reward model. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/RLHFlow/RLHF-Rewar

Introduction

In this paper, we explore the role of reward models (RMs) within the framework of Reinforcement

Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RMs play a crucial role in aligning large language models

(LLMs) as they provide a scalable way to integrate human preferences into the models’ training

process, guiding the optimization of their policies. To be more specific and provide more context,

we first review the most standard and popular RLHF frameworks and the role of RMs in this

framework. Arguably the dominant RLHF approach is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based

framework, as developed in key studies [Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al.,

2022]. This framework operates in three stages: 1) Preference data collection; 2) Reward modeling

based on the Bradley-Terry model [Bradley and Terry, 1952]; 3) Policy optimization using Proximal

Policy Optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al., 2017] and the reward model constructed in stage 2.

Gating Layer

Figure 1: Architecture of our reward model. It consists of an LLM backbone, a regression layer for

multi-objective reward modeling, and a gating layer that outputs coefficients to scalarize the reward

objectives into a scalar score.

This framework has achieved tremendous success in the post-training of ChatGPT [Ouyang et al.,

2022] and Claude [Bai et al., 2022]. These ideas also extend to other approaches, such as rejection

sampling fine-tuning [Dong et al., 2023; Gulcehre et al., 2023] and iterative direct preference learning

[Xiong et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024]. In these approaches, the intermediate policy is

typically iteratively deployed to collect new responses, uses the reward model to label the responses,

and fine-tunes the model on the newly collected preference data. In all of these RLHF frameworks,

the capacity of the reward model is crucial as it directly affects the quality of the aligned LLMs.

The most popular reward modeling approach is based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

of the Bradley-Terry (BT) model [Bradley and Terry, 1952]. Despite its widespread use, the BT

model is rather limited in the capacity of capturing the complicated human preference [Munos et al.,

2023; Swamy et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024]. In addition to the capacity issue, common RMs, like

the BT model, are typically black-box models that output scores or preferences without providing

human-interpretable explanations, making it subject to the widely observed phenomenon of reward

hacking [Skalse et al., 2022; Singhal et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024], where the aligned LLMs generate

high-reward responses (rated by the RM) that do not align with actual human preferences [Gao

et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Coste et al., 2023]. A notable example of this is the verbosity bias, where

aligned LLMs produce longer-than-necessary responses because the RM favors length, regardless of

quality [Singhal et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024].

In this work, we aim to enhance reward models by making them more interpretable [Molnar, 2020]

and steerable [Wong et al., 2021]. Using the aforementioned verbosity bias as an example, suppose

the RM’s output is decomposable, meaning that it assigns a high score to a response due to two

factors: 40% for its helpfulness and 60% for its length. In this case, we can see that the RM may

suffer from the verbosity bias. Furthermore, if the RM is steerable, we could adjust its decision-

making process to base its scoring 100% on helpfulness. This would be regardless of response length,

thus mitigating the verbosity bias. Enhancing the interpretability of RMs also allows humans to

verify whether RMs have similar internal decision processes to humans when acting as proxies for

human preferences. We believe that this human-AI interaction process could ensure that RMs are

consistent with human values and preferences, making RM-aligned LLMs more reliable and robust.

At a high level, we propose a two-stage approach that first trains a multi-objective RM and then

learns a gating layer that scalarizes reward objectives in a mixture-of-experts way. We then empir-

ically validate its effectiveness by training such an RM with Llama-3 8B [Meta, 2024], and obtain

state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench, a benchmark to evaluate RMs.

RLHF Algorithms

The PPO-based RLHF framework is first popularized in Christiano et al. [2017] and further de-

veloped by Bai et al. [2022]; Ouyang et al. [2022] to make ChatGPT and Claude, which leverages

a reward model to provide feedback during the RLHF process. However, getting the PPO work

is challenging in the context of LLMs [Choshen et al., 2019; Engstrom et al., 2020]. Thus, much

efforts have been made in proposing alternative approaches to the PPO, such as the REINFORCE

algorithm variants [Li et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024]. Another popular approach is the reward-

ranked fine-tuning algorithm (RAFT) [Dong et al., 2023; Gulcehre et al., 2023] that was used in

LLaMA2 [Touvron et al., 2023], Llama-3 [Meta, 2024], Qwen2 [qwe, 2024] and Apple Intelligence.

To implement rejection sampling, we typically sample n responses per prompt and use a reward

model to rank them according to some criteria. Then, we fine-tune the model on the high-rank

responses (e.g., the one with the highest reward value). This algorithm is a strong baseline, espe-

cially in reasoning tasks [Aksitov et al., 2023; Havrilla et al., 2024]. All approaches mentioned above

leverage external reward models to provide supervision signals during the RLHF process.

There is also a line of works studying direct preference learning algorithms [Zhao et al., 2023; Rafailov

et al., 2023; Azar et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2024], which bypasses traditional reward modeling to learn

directly from preference datasets in a supervised manner (hence the name direct preference learning).

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is the most representative one. However, the original DPO

is an offline algorithm without further exploration of the environments. The subsequent studies

demonstrate that the online iterative variants surpass the original DPO with large margins [Xiong

et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Rosset et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024;

Zhang et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2024]. Specifically, we can iteratively deploy the intermediate policy

to collect new responses and use the external reward model to label them, and further fine-tune the

model on the newly collected preference data using the DPO objective.

To summarize, all the existing popular RLHF algorithms require an external reward model to provide

preference signals to achieve their best performance.

2.2

Reward modeling in RLHF

Traditionally, reward models in RLHF have utilized the Bradley-Terry (BT) model for preference

estimation [Bradley and Terry, 1952; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b;

Rafailov et al., 2023]. Despite its widespread use, the BT model’s inability to handle complex, in-

transitive preferences has been highlighted in recent studies [Munos et al., 2023; Swamy et al., 2024;

Ye et al., 2024]. It is also argued that the DPO-aligned model can serve as a reward function to

provide token-wise rewards [Rafailov et al., 2024; Zhong et al., 2024], which are still confined to the

BT model. There are also works dropping the BT assumption and directly modeling the probability

of response one being preferred over another one [Jiang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Liu et al.,

2023; Dong et al., 2024]. These models are referred to as the pairwise preference model, as they

take two responses as the input. Another line of work explores multi-objective reward models that

3

## Page 4

attempt to capture the complicated human preferences more effectively [Touvron et al., 2023; Wang

et al., 2023a, 2024a]. However, the integration of these multi-dimensional signals typically relies on

naive methods such as linear combinations, indicating a need for more sophisticated techniques.

Methodology

3.1

Multi-Objective Reward Modeling

Most existing reward models for LLM alignment are trained with Bradley-Terry loss on pairwise

data with annotated preferences [Bai et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022], using

the same approach as InstructGPT [Ouyang et al., 2022]. The pairwise preference annotations are

essentially binary labels, e.g., {0, 1}, indicating which response is preferred by the annotator. We

call them relative ratings here. However, in some recent high-quality datasets, the relative ratings

are converted from absolute ratings.

For instance, UltraFeedback [Cui et al., 2023] is curated

with 5-objective absolute ratings: Overall Score, Instruction Following, Truthfulness, Honesty, and

Helpfulness (each objective has 5 distinct ratings based on pre-defined rubrics). The dataset is

further binarized into pairwise comparisons, using the Overall Score, or the average score of the

remaining 4 objectives, for training reward models or DPO. The original ratings are fine-grained,

as each objective has continuous integer rating scores (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). However, the binarization

process discards some fine-grained information. For example, a pair of examples with scores 1:5

is labeled in the same way as another pair with scores 2:3. It is not justified that discarding the

fine-grained preference information is beneficial. Hence, we would like to include all fine-grained

information for reward modeling.

As the training examples come with multi-objective ratings, the straightforward approach for learn-

ing with these ratings is multi-objective regression1. Here, we briefly introduce the training pro-

cedure.

We consider each example to consist of a prompt x (including contexts from previous

conversation turns), response y, and a k-dimensional rating vector r ∈Rk, where each dimension

corresponds to a reward objective such as helpfulness and truthfulness. Now, we take a pre-trained

decoder-only LLM without the original output linear layer as the feature extractor fθ. We pass

x ⊕y, the concatenation of x and y, through the decoder layers and take the hidden state of the

final decoder layer on the last token as a d-dimensional feature. Also, we attach a new linear re-

gression layer w ∈Rd×k on top of fθ, which outputs a k-dimensional rating prediction. The model

can be simply trained with regression loss:

min

θ,w Ex,y,r∈D∥w⊤fθ(x ⊕y) −r∥2

3.2

Mixture-of-Experts Scalarization of Reward Objectives

An ArmoRM can predict multi-objective rewards for each response. However, the multi-dimensional

outputs need to be reduced to a scalar for ranking or pairwise comparisons of test examples. A

straightforward approach is to take a linear combination of multiple objectives [Hu et al., 2024]

as in the literature of multitask learning.

However, using fixed combination coefficients is too

rigid for complex application scenarios. For instance, for prompts that could easily trigger unsafe

responses, the safety objective should be assigned a large coefficient, as we wish the reward model

to rank unsafe responses lower than safe ones. For prompts for math problem assistance, the safety

objective becomes less relevant, and the helpfulness-related objectives should be the primary focus.

1This approach is also adopted in Directional Preference Alignment [Wang et al., 2024a] and HelpSteer [Wang

et al., 2023a].

## Page 5

With the insight mentioned above, we propose a MoE-style scalarization of reward objectives,

conditioned on the prompt x. On the architecture level, we just need to follow the common MoE

practice to add a gating layer, gϕ : Rd 7→{v ∈Rk | vi ≥0 and P vi = 1}, that outputs non-negative

coefficients (summing up to 1) for the reward objectives based on the feature extracted from the

prompt, fθ(x) ∈Rd, i.e., the hidden state on the last token of x. Notice that fθ(x) is provided for

free in the forward pass of fθ(x ⊕y), making the pipeline inference-efficient.

The gating layer gϕ can simply be a shallow MLP (i.e., fully-connected network) that takes the

prompt feature fθ(x) and outputs a k-dimensional vector, followed by a softmax function to ensure

the elements of the output vector are non-negative and summing up to 1.

However, most reward objectives are highly correlated with verbosity, which indicates a strong

verbosity bias [Saito et al., 2023].

Using non-negative gating coefficients would make the final

output inherit the bias. To resolve the issue, we adjust each reward objective, ri, with a penalty

using the verbosity reward objective,

r′

i ←ri −λirverbose

(2)

where the penalty coefficient λi is chosen such that for a proper correction metric (e.g., Pearson or

Spearman correlation coefficient) and a reference data distribution D,

CorrD(r′

i, rverbose) = 0

(3)

The adjusted reward vector is denoted as r′ ∈Rk.

Finally, we multiply the gating coefficients to the multi-objective rewards, to obtain a scalar score

s for the response y given prompt x,

R = gϕ(fθ(x))⊤r′

(4)

To train the gating layer, we freeze the backbone and the regression layer, and only train the gating

layer using the Bradley-Terry loss with an additional scaling variable, β ∈R,

min

−log

exp(βRchosen)

where Rchosen and Rrejected are the preference scores for the chosen and rejected responses in each

pairwise example, (x, ychosen, yrejected).

Experiment

Implementation of ArmoRM.

We use the Llama-3 8B [Meta, 2024] architecture and initialize

the model backbone with parameters from a Bradley-Terry RM of Llama-3 8B trained by Dong et al.

[2024]. We append a linear layer to the backbone, and train it with regression loss while keeping the

backbone frozen. The training involves 19 objectives (including helpfulness, correctness, verbosity,

etc.) from 8 datasets, with details presented in Appendix A.

Implementation of MoE.

The gating layer is a ReLU MLP of 3 hidden layers with 1024 hidden

units. For the correlation metric Corr in Eq. (3), we adopt the Spearman correlation [Spearman,

1904], and use UltraFeedback [Cui et al., 2023] as the reference data distribution D. The scaling

variable β is initialized with a value of 100, and the gating layer is trained with the LLM backbone

kept frozen. The training is conducted on 10 pairwise preference datasets, with details in Appendix

## A.

Software.

Our training code is built with PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019], HuggingFace’s Trans-

formers [Wolf et al., 2019] and Scikit-learn [Pedregosa et al., 2011].

Hardware.

Training ArmoRM (the multi-objective reward modeling stage) only involves training

the last linear layer (i.e., linear probing), so we save features extracted from the backbone locally

and then conduct linear probing with Scikit-learn’s linear regression solver on a CPU. For the MoE

stage, we also save features locally, and then train the gating layer on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU.

Hyperparameters.

The gating layer is trained using the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and

Hutter, 2019] with a learning rate of 0.001 for 10,000 steps with a batch size of 1024. We also apply

a cosine decay learning rate scheduler.

Evaluation Benchmark.

RewardBench [Lambert et al., 2024] is the first benchmark constructed

to evaluate reward models for language modeling. It consists of a diverse set of tasks designed to

assess the performance of reward models for LLM alignment, including four primary categories

(Chat, Chat Hard, Safety, Reasoning) and a category of prior sets.

Each category consists of

multiple datasets with pairwise preference data, where each pair includes a chosen and a rejected

text response. The overall score is computed as a weighted average over the five categories, where

the four primary categories have weights 1.0 and the prior-sets category has weight 0.5.

Evaluation Results.

Table 1 compares the performance of our approach (ArmoRM + MoE)

against other reward models. Several key observations can be made from these results:

• Our model significantly outperforms the Llama-3 8B Bradley-Terry RM, which provides the LLM

backbone for our model. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our ArmoRM design and the

MoE gating mechanism in improving the performance of reward models.

• Our model also outperforms the LLM-as-a-judge approach [Zheng et al., 2023] with GPT-4 judges

by a considerable margin, indicating that our model could be used as a cheaper replacement for

GPT-4 in many annotation jobs.

• Our model of 8B parameters has performance nearly on par with the Nemotron-4 340B RM Wang

et al. [2024b], a giant reward model of 340B parameters. This highlights the power and potential

of our reward modeling approach.

Conclusion

In this work, we addressed the critical issue of interpretability in reward models for RLHF in

the context of aligning LLMs with human preferences. We proposed a novel two-stage approach,

consisting of an ArmoRM and a MoE strategy with a gating network. Our ArmoRM, trained with

Llama-3 8B, achieved state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench, demonstrating the effectiveness

of our reward modeling approach.

Experimental Details

Licenses.

The model we use and fine-tune follows the Meta Llama3 license. All the datasets we

use are open-sourced and can be used for research purposes (some could be used for commercial

purposes, such as HelpSteer [Wang et al., 2023a]).

Personally Identifying Info or Offensive Content.

For all datasets used in this work, ac-

cording to their data curation process descriptions, they do not contain any information that names

or uniquely identifies individual people, except for some examples that contain celebrity names.

However, BeaverTails [Ji et al., 2023], PKU-RLHF [Ji et al., 2023], and HH-RLHF [Bai et al.,

2022; Ganguli et al., 2022] contain offensive content, which is deliberately selected to build human

preference datasets that aim to teach LLMs which responses are safe to generate.

Multi-Objective Training Datasets.

In the stage of multi-objective reward modeling, we use

training datasets with corresponding reward objectives detailed below.

• HelpSteer [Wang et al., 2023a] (35k data):

– helpsteer-helpfulness

– helpsteer-correctness

– helpsteer-coherence

– helpsteer-complexity

– helpsteer-verbosity (This is the verbosity objective we use in Eq. (2) and (3))

• UltraFeedback [Cui et al., 2023] (240k data):

– ultrafeedback-overall-score

– ultrafeedback-instruction-following

– ultrafeedback-truthfulness

– ultrafeedback-honesty

– ultrafeedback-helpfulness

• BeaverTails-30k [Ji et al., 2023] (30k data):

– beavertails-is-safe

• CodeUltraFeedback [Weyssow et al., 2024] (50k data):

– code-complexity

– code-style

– code-explanation

– code-instruction-following

– code-readability

• Prometheus [Kim et al., 2024a] (200k data):

– prometheus-score

• Argilla-Capybara2 [Daniele and Suphavadeeprasit, 2023] (15k data):

– argilla-overall-quality

• Argilla-OpenOrca3 (13k data):

– argilla-judge-lm

• Argilla-Math-Preference4 (2.4k data): This dataset shares the objective ultrafeedback-instruction-

following with UltraFeedback

Multi-Objective Data Pre-processing.

When merging multiple datasets with absolute ratings

(e.g., UltraFeedback and HelpSteer), we observe some issues with the data. Here, we present the

issues and our approach to tackle them:

• Different Rating Scales: Different datasets may have different scales for the ratings.

For

instance, HelpSteer has a rating scale of 0-4, while UltraFeedback’s is 1-10. We linearly transform

all ratings to make them between 0 and 1. For BeaverTails with True/False ratings (indicating

safe or unsafe), we treat True as 1 and False as 0.

• Similar Objectives: There are some very similar objectives from different datasets. For exam-

ple, the Helpfulness objective appears in both HelpSteer and UltraFeedback, and the Correctness

objective of HelpSteer is quite similar to the Truthfulness of UltraFeedback. After carefully ex-

amining the datasets, we decided to treat similar objectives as separate objectives, as they are

rated by different judges following different rubrics. For instance, data from HelpSteer are rated

by 200 U.S.-based human annotators following customized rubrics, and UltraFeedback data are

labeled with GPT-4 following another set of rubrics.

• Missing Labels of the Merged Dataset: When merging multiple datasets, each example

of the merged dataset only has a subset of ratings; for example, each example from HelpSteer

only has 5 ratings originating from the HelpSteer dataset, and it does not have ratings for other

objectives (e.g., the objectives from UltraFeedback or BeaverTails). Hence, when optimizing the

regression loss, we simply ignore the missing rating dimensions of each example and only compute

the loss on the remaining dimensions.

Training Data of MoE.

In the stage of the gating layer, we use the following preference datasets:

• HelpSteer [Wang et al., 2023a] (37k pairs)

• UltraFeedback [Cui et al., 2023] (340k pairs)

• SHP [Ethayarajh et al., 2022] (93k pairs)

• HH-RLHF [Bai et al., 2022; Ganguli et al., 2022] (157k pairs)

• PKU-SafeRLHF-30K [Ji et al., 2023]

• Argilla-Capybara (15k pairs)

• Argilla-Math-Preferences (2.4k pairs)

• CodeUltraFeedback [Weyssow et al., 2024] (50k pairs)

• PRM-Phase-2 [Lightman et al., 2023] (80k pairs)

• Prometheus2-Preference-Collection [Kim et al., 2024b] (200k pairs)

Preference Data Pre-processing.

For datasets that are not binarized into response pairs (e.g.,

HelpSteer, UltraFeedback, SHP), we take the binarized versions pre-processed in Dong et al. [2024].
