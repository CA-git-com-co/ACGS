## Abstract

Process Reward Modeling (PRM) is critical for complex reasoning and decision-

making tasks where the accuracy of intermediate steps significantly influences the

overall outcome. Existing PRM approaches, primarily framed as classification

problems, employ cross-entropy loss to independently evaluate each step’s cor-

rectness. This method can lead to suboptimal reward distribution and does not

adequately address the interdependencies among steps. To address these limita-

tions, we introduce the Process Q-value Model (PQM), a novel framework that

redefines PRM in the context of a Markov Decision Process. PQM optimizes Q-

value rankings based on a novel comparative loss function, enhancing the model’s

ability to capture the intricate dynamics among sequential decisions. This ap-

proach provides a more granular and theoretically grounded methodology for pro-

cess rewards. Our extensive empirical evaluations across various sampling poli-

cies, language model backbones, and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that

PQM outperforms classification-based PRMs. The effectiveness of the compara-

tive loss function is highlighted in our comprehensive ablation studies, confirming

PQM’s practical efficacy and theoretical advantage. Our codes can be found at

## Introduction

Process reward modeling (PRM) plays a crucial role in tasks where the quality of intermediate steps

is pivotal to achieving the final outcome (Lightman et al., 2024). In complex problem-solving sce-

narios, such as mathematical reasoning or multi-step decision-making (Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al.,

2024; Hao et al., 2024), the accuracy and effectiveness of each intermediate action can significantly

influence the overall success. Unlike outcome reward models (ORM) (Cobbe et al., 2021), which

focus solely on the final result, PRM provides detailed feedback at each stage of the process. By

capturing the value of intermediate steps, PRM allows for a deeper understanding of how each action

contributes to the overall goal. This granular approach supports the development of more sophisti-

cated and reliable systems that can navigate complex tasks with greater accuracy.

Existing research typically frames PRM as a classification problem (Wang et al., 2023a; Shao et al.,

2024; Lightman et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024), where each intermediate state is classified as correct

or incorrect. Specifically, for a trajectory {x, a1, a2, . . . , aH} where x, a, H represent a question,

a reasoning step, and the trajectory horizon, a reasoning state si = (x, a1:i−1) comprises the in-

struction x and text pieces previously generated (e.g. reasoning steps in reasoning tasks). Current

research uses cross-entropy loss to maximize the probability p(ci|si) for each reasoning state, where

ci is the label indicating whether si is correct. While this approach has shown empirical success,

it has notable limitations. Classification-based methods treat each state independently and do not

account for the dependencies and nuances among states within a trajectory. This can lead to subop-

timal reward assignments, as these methods often ignore the relative importance of different steps

and their influence on the overall process. Furthermore, these approaches lack theoretical grounding

on how they approximate the desired reward function.

To address the challenges, we propose a novel framework—Process Q-value Model (PQM)—which

frames PRM as a Q-value ranking problem. This framework allows us to capture the interdependen-

cies among states and provides a more nuanced evaluation of each step’s contribution to the overall

process. Specifically, our framework is grounded in the Markov Dynamic Process, where each ac-

tion ah is a text piece generated based on the current state sh = (x, a1:h−1). The LLM policy

π(ah|x, a1:h−1) maps the observed state to a distribution over the action space. The process reward

model intuitively scores each action ah based on the instruction x and previous generations a1:h−1.

In the context of reasoning tasks, we introduce a Q-value function for each state-action pair (sh, ah)

as the probability of success in achieving the correct final answer. Importantly, the Q-value function

implicitly defines a reward function for intermediate steps. Under this characterization, we formally

derive the optimal Q-value rankings among reasoning steps, by which we then train PRMs to ap-

proximate these rankings with a specialized comparative loss function. According to Theorem 3.5,

Q-values ascend with the continuation of correct steps and descend as wrong steps proceed, while

having a prominent gap between correct and wrong steps (see Fig. 1). We further prove that the

previous classification-based PRM can be cast as a special case of our theoretical framework under

certain conditions.

We conduct comprehensive experiments, revealing the significant advantages of the PQM over prior

methods. Following prior research (Wang et al., 2023a; Lightman et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024), we

evaluate PRMs based on their verification ability through best-of-n sampling. The metric assesses

the correctness of the most preferred trajectory selected by the PRM from n candidates for each

question. Compared to classification-based PRMs, our ranking-based method PQM demonstrates

superior accuracy in verification, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing nuanced dependencies

among steps. For example, when verifying solutions sampled from the Llama-3-70B-Instruct model,

PQM improves the accuracy from 39.8% to 51.4%, a direct 11.6% improvement on the challenging

MATH500 benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). These results are consistent across diverse datasets,

sampling policies, and LLM backbones, underscoring PQM’s effectiveness and generalizability.

To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:

1. We present a new framework for PRM by framing it as a Q-value ranking problem, provid-

ing a theoretical basis for process reward modeling that captures inter-dependencies among

reasoning states. We also show that prior classification-based PRM can be cast as a special

case under our framework.

2. We offer a detailed theoretical analysis of PQM and validate its effectiveness through com-

prehensive experiments on a wide range of sampling policies, LLM backbones, and differ-

ent test sets.

3. We perform extensive ablation studies on the proposed comparative training objective, and

analyze its variations to understand their impact on the model’s performance and design.

## Preliminaries

LLMs for reasoning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive abilities on challenging

reasoning tasks across a wide range of math, science, and coding challenges. Chain of thought (Wei

et al., 2022) and related techniques (Wang et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2024a;b) have

emerged as dominant methods, linking the question and the final answer by a series of intermediate

reasoning steps. For a given question x and its corresponding answer y, extensive studies (Wei et al.,

2022; Chen et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2024a;b) have shown that prompting LLMs to

arrive at solutions via intermediate steps {a1, a2, . . . } can produce more interpretable and accurate

results. To generate the final answer, each intermediate step is sampled in an auto-regressive manner:

2

## Page 3

at ∼πθ(·|x, a1:t−1), where πθ denotes an LLM policy parameterized by θ. The final answer is then

generated by y ∼πθ(·|x, a1, a2, · · · ). Note that the final answer can be considered the last reasoning

step, so we omit y in our subsequent discussion.

ORM vs. PRM. Outcome reward model (ORM) and process reward model (PRM) represent two

distinct approaches to reward assignment in decision-making tasks, particularly in the context of

reinforcement learning and language models. ORMs focus on the final outcome, assigning rewards

based solely on the end state (Cobbe et al., 2021), which is advantageous when the end goal is

clear and well-defined. For example, this approach has been popularly used in LLM alignment

frameworks for learning human preferences, where the emphasis is on aligning the model’s final

output with human judgments (Ouyang et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2024b; Khanov

et al., 2024; Im & Li, 2024). However, ORMs often overlook the nuances of the process that lead to

the final outcome, potentially ignoring valuable information embedded in the intermediate steps for

multi-step reasoning tasks (Uesato et al., 2022).

In contrast, OpenAI’s recent work on PRM (Lightman et al., 2024) has shown promise in assigning

rewards based on the quality or characteristics of the intermediate steps. PRMs are particularly

useful in tasks that require complex reasoning or multi-step problem-solving, where the path taken to

reach the solution is as important as the solution itself. By rewarding intermediate steps, PRMs can

encourage more interpretable and structured problem-solving processes, offering a more granular

training signal that captures the intricacies of the decision-making process.

Process reward modeling with BCE loss. For a question and a trajectory with several steps, τ =

(x, a1, a2, . . . , aH), current research on process reward models (Wang et al., 2023a; Shao et al.,

2024; Lightman et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024) typically frames PRMs as a classification problem.

This approach aims to maximize the predicted correctness of each reasoning state using a binary

cross-entropy (BCE) loss,

LBCE(τ) = −1

## H

,

(1)

where ci is the gold classification label of i-th step, equal to 1 when si is a correct intermediate

state otherwise 0. Despite its effectiveness, BCE loss treats each intermediate state independently

and does not account for the interdependencies among the reasoning states within a trajectory. By

treating each state in isolation, BCE loss overlooks the relative contribution each step makes. More-

over, the theoretical support for PRM formulation is also lacking. These limitations motivate our

approach of formulating process reward modeling as a Q-value ranking problem grounded in the

Markov Dynamic Process, where the focus shifts to evaluating the relative quality of different steps

in a solution trajectory, thus capturing the interdependencies among steps and providing a more

holistic approach to reward assignment.

## Pqm: Process Reward Model With Q-Value Rankings

In this section, we introduce our framework PQM, which frames process reward modeling as a

Q-value ranking problem. In what follows, we first define a Q-value function for reasoning tasks,

which implicitly defines a reward function for each intermediate step (Section 3.2). Then, we derive

the desirable Q-value rankings among intermediate reasoning steps (Section 3.3), by which we can

train PRMs to approximate the intermediate Q-values by a comparison-based loss (Section 3.4).

Lastly, we demonstrate that classification-based PRMs can be viewed as a special case within our

theoretical framework (Section 3.5).

3.1

## Deterministic Mdp For Llms

Formulations of MDP. A standard Markov Dynamic Process can be formulated as M

=

(S, A, T , r, ρ, H), where S is the state space, A is the action space, T : S × A →∆(S) is the

transition kernel, r is the reward function, ρ denotes the initial state distribution, and H is the max-

imal number of interaction steps. A policy in MDPs, denoted by π : S →∆(A), maps each state

to a distribution over actions. The interaction between the environment M and the agent can be

described as follows. Initially, the starting state s1 is sampled from the initial distribution ρ. At

each step t, the agent observes the current state st and selects an action at based on its policy. The

3

environment then transits to the next state st+1, which is sampled from the distribution T (·|st, at).

This process continues until a termination condition is met, which will be triggered within H steps.

Deterministic MDP for LLMs. In text generation scenarios, the transition kernel T is deterministic,

as each new state is formed by concatenating the previous tokens with the current output. The

length limit for LLM outputs is characterized by H. Initially, an instruction x is sampled from an

initial distribution ρ. Each subsequent state st = (x, a1:t−1) comprises the instruction x and text

pieces previously generated (e.g. reasoning steps in reasoning tasks). Each action at is a text piece

generated based on the current state st. The LLM policy π(at|x, a1:t−1) maps the observed state

to a distribution over the action space. The process reward model, r : S × A →R, intuitively

scores each action at based on the instruction x and previous generations a1:t−1. For simplicity, the

instruction x is omitted in the state notation (x, a1:t) thereafter when no ambiguity arises.

3.2

## Defining Q-Function Implicitly Defines A Reward Function

Recall that the state-action value Q(s, a) (Mnih et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2020; Setlur et al., 2024)

typically represents the expected benefit of taking a specific action a to achieve a correct answer. In

the context of reasoning tasks, we define the Q-value function as the success probability of achieving

the correct final answer. Specifically, the Q-value function is defined as

Qπ(a1:t−1, at) := σ−1

Eat+1:H∼π(·|a1:t)I(x, a1:H)



,

(2)

where π is a policy, H is the maximum step number, σ is the sigmoid function and σ−1 is its inverse

function to ensure Q ∈R. I is an indicator function, which equals 1 if the trajectory reaches the

correct answer of x, and 0 otherwise. For simplicity, we also denote Q(a1:t−1, at) as Qt when there

is no ambiguity.

Lemma 3.1. (Ng et al., 1999) For two reward functions r(st, at) and r′(st, at), if there exists

a potential function Φ(s) satisfying r′(st, at) = r(st, at) + Φ(st+1) −Φ(st), these two reward

functions results in the same optimal policy.

Given this lemma, defining the Q-value function implicitly defines a corresponding reward function.

Lemma 3.2. Under deterministic MDP, the advantage function of the optimal policy π∗can function

the same as the reward function leading to π∗.

Proof. Due to the deterministic MDP setting, we have A∗(st, at) = r(st, at) + V ∗(st+1) −V∗(st)

where we denote the Q, V -value under the optimal policy π∗as Q∗, V ∗. Hence, with Lemma 3.1,

we have the advantage function of the optimal policy functions the same as the reward function.

With the definition in Eq. 2, the advantage function of the optimal policy can be formulated as

A∗(st, at) = Q∗(st, at) −Eat∼π∗(·|st)Q∗(st, at) = Q∗(st, at) −Q∗(st−1, at−1)

Thus, our objective is to approximate the Q-function of the optimal policy. However, the optimal

policy is not known in advance and varies across different algorithms. To establish the relationships

between Q-values at intermediate steps, we introduce the following mild assumption regarding ideal

optimal policies.

Assumption 3.1. For an ideal optimal policy π∗, the next step based on a correct state is more likely

to be correct than be wrong, i.e. P∗(at+1|a1:t) ≫P∗(at+1|a1:t), which follows achieving correct

answer from a correct state is much easier than from a wrong state, i.e. P∗(τ|s) > P∗(τ|s).

In Section 4.3, we will further empirically validate this assumption. For the parameter notations of

Pπ(·), we use the original notations to represent the correctness of states and an overline to indicate

incorrectness. For example, Pπ(at+1|a1:t) denotes the probability that policy π will produce an

incorrect next step given the correct state sequence a1:t, and Pπ(τ|s) represents the probability that

the policy π generates a correct trajectory from an incorrect state s. P∗is shorthand for Pπ∗, where

π∗is the optimal policy. Using the above definitions and assumptions, we can collect comparative

labels to approximate Q-values, which will be introduced next.

3.3

## Optimal Q-Value Ranking

In this subsection, we derive the Q-value rankings among intermediate reasoning steps. In our main

Theorem 3.5, we establish that Q-values ascend with the continuation of correct steps and descend

4

## Page 5

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025

as wrong steps proceed, while maintaining a significant gap between correct and wrong steps. To

arrive at this result, we first derive the pairwise relationship between Q-values of an earlier step and

a later step in Lemma 3.3. Next we show the relationship between the first correct step and the

first incorrect step in Lemma 3.4. Finally, we combine these intermediate relationships to derive an

integrated ranking across the entire trajectory.

We start by introducing a few lemmas that are useful for deriving our main Theorem 3.5. For any

two actions an, am s.t. n < m in a solution trajectory τ = (x, a1, a2, ...aH), we have

P∗(τ|a1:n) = P∗(a1:m|a1:n)P∗(τ|a1:m) + P∗(a1:m|a1:n)P∗(τ|a1:m),

(3)

P∗(τ|a1:n) = P∗(a1:m|a1:n)P∗(τ|a1:m) + P∗(a1:m|a1:n)P∗(τ|a1:m),

(4)

which directly follows the Bayesian factorization. P∗(a1:m|a1:n) denotes the possibility that policy

generate correct state a1:m conditioned on a wrong state a1:n. For a solution τ = (x, a1, a2, ...aH),

recall the Q function in Eq.2, we define Q∗

σ(a1:t−1, at) = σ(Q∗(a1:t−1, at)) = P∗(τ|a1:t)

where σ is the sigmoid function. Since σ is a monotonically increasing function, hence when

## Q∗

σ(a1:m−1, am) > Q∗

σ(a1:n−1, an) for any two steps am, an, we have Q∗(a1:m−1, am) >

Q∗(a1:n−1, an). Then we can obtain the following lemma.

Lemma 3.3. For two steps an, am in a solution τ where n < m, if they are both correct, we

have Q∗(a1:n−1, an) < Q∗(a1:m−1, am). If an, am are both wrong, we have Q∗(a1:n−1, an) >

Q∗(a1:m−1, am).

Proof. We first analyze the difference between the two correct steps as follows,

## Q∗

σ(a1:n−1, an) −Q∗

σ(a1:m−1, am)

= P∗(am|a1:n)P∗(τ|a1:m) + P∗(am|a1:n)P∗(τ|a1:m) −P∗(τ|a1:m)

= P∗(am|a1:n)[P∗(τ|a1:m) −P∗(τ|a1:m)],

(5)

where the first equation uses the Q-function definition and Eq. 4, the second equation uses

P∗(am|a1:n) + P∗(am|a1:n) = 1. With the Assumption 3.1, we have P∗(τ|a1:m) −P∗(τ|a1:m) <

0. Hence, when an and am are both correct, we have Q∗(a1:n−1, an) < Q∗(a1:m−1, am). Similar

to the above proof, we can factorize the Q-value difference between two incorrect steps as follows,

## Q∗

σ(a1:n−1, an) −Q∗

σ(a1:m−1, am) = P∗(am|a1:n)[P∗(τ|a1:m) −P∗(τ|a1:m)].

(6)

With the Assumption 3.1 where P∗(τ|a1:m) > P∗(τ|a1:m), if an, am are both incorrect, we have

Q∗(a1:n−1, an) > Q∗(a1:m−1, am).

Additionally, considering the initial situation intermediate steps and V∗(x), we have the following

lemma.

Lemma 3.4. For the first correct step an and the first incorrect step am, we have Q∗(a1:n−1, an) >

V∗(x) ≫Q∗(a1:m−1, am).

Proofs. Considering the first correct step an, similar to the proof in Lemma 3.3, we have

## Q∗

σ(a1:n−1, an) −V∗

σ(x) = P∗(τ|a1:n) −P∗(τ|x) = P∗(an|x)(P∗(τ|a1:n) −P∗(τ|a1:n)) (7)

## Q∗

σ(a1:m−1, am) −V∗

σ(x) = P∗(τ|a1:m) −P∗(τ|x) = P∗(am|x)(P∗(τ|a1:m) −P∗(τ|a1:m))

(8)

Hence, we have Q∗(a1:m−1, am) < V∗(x) < Q∗(a1:n−1, an). Now, we obtain the ordering of the

Q-value difference, but the specific discrepancy between intermediate steps has not been discussed

yet. With Assumption 3.1, for an ideal π∗, we have P∗(an|x) ≪P∗(am|x). Hence, the difference

between V∗(x) and the Q-value of the first correct step is much smaller than the difference between

V∗(x) and the Q-value of the first incorrect step.

Based on the above derivations, we can rank the state-action Q-values for the whole trajectory. We

formalize the ranking in the following theorem.

Theorem 3.5 (Q-value ranking among reasoning steps). Formally, for a trajectory τ with H

steps, C = [c1, c2, . . . , c|C|] denotes the index list of the correct intermediate steps, where c1 <

c2 < · · · < c|C|, W = [w1, w2, . . . , w|W |] denotes the index list of the wrong intermediate steps,

where w1 < w2 < · · · < w|W |, we have

## Q∗

w|W | < · · · < Q∗

w2 < Q∗

w1 ≪Q∗

## 0 < Q∗

c1 < Q∗

c2 < · · · < Q∗

c|C|,

where Q∗

0 = V ∗(x), | · | denotes the length of the list, and |C| + |W| = H.

## Comparative Loss Function For Optimizing Q-Value Rankings

Given the optimal Q-value ranking derived in Theorem 3.5, we now propose a new comparative loss

that trains RPM to approximate the intermediate Q-values. While the ranking relationship can be

captured by the classical Plackett-Luce (PL) ranking model (Plackett, 1975; Luce, 1959), there are

significant limitations when using the canonical PL loss directly in this context. The standard PL

loss is designed to handle general ranking scenarios without accounting for the varying degrees of

discrepancy within the ranking. However, in our case, the Q-value gaps between correct and incor-

rect steps are often highly pronounced (cf. Lemma 3.4), leading to a situation where the standard PL

model may not adequately capture the importance of these differences. As discussed in Section 4.3,

this results in suboptimal performance, since the PL loss does not differentiate sufficiently between

steps that are only marginally different in rank versus those with substantial Q-value gaps.

Comparative loss with Q-value margin.

To address the limitation, we adapt the vanilla PL loss

to better reflect these discrepancies. Our proposed loss function is designed to emphasize the signifi-

cant gaps in Q-values, ensuring that the model learns to prioritize these differences in a theoretically

justified manner. The loss is defined as:

Ltheorem = −1

## H

h |W |

## X

t=2

log

exp(Qwt)

Pt

q=1 exp Qwq

+

## |C|

## X

t=0

log

exp(Qct)

Pt

q=0 exp Qcq + P

w∈W exp(Qw + ζ)

i

, (9)

where ζ is a margin hyperparameter introduced to emphasize the gap between correct and incorrect

steps, and 0 is inserted at the beginning of C for clarity.

Practically, prior research (Wang et al., 2023a; Shao et al., 2024) often treats all steps following

the first incorrect step as wrong. Specifically, for a given trajectory τ = {a1, . . . , al−1, al, . . . , aH}

where a1:l−1 are correct steps and al is the first incorrect step, existing data corpora typically catego-

rize all subsequent steps al:H as incorrect. This approach leads to a situation where the wrong steps

are not necessarily accurately annotated, as they are all uniformly marked as incorrect. To address

this issue and explore a practically effective loss function, we investigate several variations of the

comparative loss function. Our practical implementation, which will be discussed in Section 4.3, is

designed to better handle this scenario. The proposed loss function is:

## L = −1

## |C|

## |C|

## X

t=0

log

exp(Qct)

Pt

q=0 exp Qcq + P

w∈W exp(Qw + ζ)

.

(10)

In this formulation, ζ is a positive scalar that adjusts the relative importance of incorrect steps,

and Q0 is set to 0 to simplify the computation. Comparing to Ltheorem, this objective disregards

the internal rankings among incorrect steps, focusing solely on the relative rankings among cor-

rect steps and the substantial discrepancy between the Q-values of correct and incorrect steps, i.e.

## {Q∗

w|W |, . . . , Q∗

w2, Q∗

w1} ≪Q∗

## 0 < Q∗

c1 < Q∗

c2 < · · · < Q∗

c|C|. We will perform extensive ablation

comparing L and Ltheorem in Section 4.3.

3.5

## Classification-Based Prm Is A Special Case Of Q-Value Approximators

We show that the previous classification-based PRM can be cast as a special case of our framework

under certain conditions. To illustrate this, consider an extreme scenario where the assumptions

outlined in Assumption 3.1 are satisfied, namely, when P∗(at+1|a1:t) →1 and P∗(at+1|a1:t) →1.

According to the Q-function definition provided in Eq. 2 and leveraging Bayesian Factorization, it

follows that classification-based PRMs approximate Q-value rankings under these conditions.

Lemma 3.6. Formally, when P∗(at+1|a1:t) →1 and P∗(at+1|a1:t) →1 for any t, we have

## Q∗

σ(a1:m−1, am) = 1 for any correct step am and Q∗

σ(a1:n−1, an) = 0 for any wrong step an.

Proof. This result can be derived directly from Bayesian Factorization, which states:

P∗(τ|a1:m) =

## H

## Y

t=m+1

P∗(at|a1:t−1), P∗(τ|a1:n) =

## H

## Y

t=n+1

P∗(at|a1:t−1).

(11)

Therefore, for a correct step, we have Q∗

σ(a1:m−1, am) = P∗(τ|a1:m) = 1 and for a wrong step,

we have Q∗

σ(a1:n−1, an) = 1 −P∗(τ|a1:n) = 0. Thus, the cross-entropy loss used in classification-

based PRMs can be interpreted as estimating the Q-value without bias.

## Experiments

4.1

## Experimental Settings

Datasets and metrics. Following previous research (Wang et al., 2023a; Lightman et al., 2024;

Luo et al., 2024), we evaluate PRMs based on their verification ability through best-of-n sampling.

The metric, BON@n, assesses the correctness of the most preferred trajectory selected by the PRM

from n candidates for each question. During the evaluation, the PRM first scores every step within

each trajectory. Consistent with prior studies (Wang et al., 2023a), the final score of a trajectory is

determined by the minimum score of its individual steps. The test corpus includes 128 solutions

for each question from GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024) and MATH500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021) datasets.

These solutions are sampled from three policy models with strong performance in math tasks with

different scales: MetaMath-Mistral-7B (Yu et al., 2024), MuggleMath-13B (Li et al., 2023a), Llama-

3-70B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024). We utilize the existing off-shelf corpus, Math-Shepherd (Wang

et al., 2023a), as our training corpus.

Baselines and implementation details. Consistent with prior works (Wang et al., 2023a; Lightman

et al., 2024), we evaluate the performance of PRM by comparing it against the outcome reward

model (ORM). We also compare our comparative loss with the BCE loss, which is employed in

Math-Shepherd. Additionally, some research (Zhang et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024) adopt more

strict MSE loss to minimize the distance between the predicted value and the label. We implement

MSE loss with two versions: 0-1 label and iterative Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to estimate

the continuous label for MSE loss as in Zhang et al. (2024a). For the model architecture, we adopt

general reward model frameworks, incorporating a value head on top of the Deepseek-7B-base LLM

(Shao et al., 2024). This value head projects the latent representation of the model into a scalar value,

facilitating the evaluation of intermediate steps and trajectories. More detailed implementation in-

formation, including specific configurations and experimental setups, can be found in Appendix B.

4.2

## Main Results

Verification performance across different policy models.

Experimental results are shown in Ta-

ble 1. Our proposed PQM demonstrates significant performance improvements over all baselines.

Firstly, PQM outperforms the outcome reward model, which is consistent with prior findings that

process-based methods provide a more nuanced evaluation of intermediate steps. Moreover, when

compared to classification-based PRM models using BCE or MSE loss, PQM shows a notable ad-

vantage. For example, when verifying solutions sampled from the Llama-3-70B-Instruct model,

Figure 2: Integration of our approach PQM with self-consistency (SC) on three policy models,

MetaMath-7B-Mistral (left), MuggleMath-13B (middle), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (right). The evalu-

ation is conducted on MATH500. Numbers in brackets denote the value of ζ.

PQM improves the accuracy from 39.8% (BCE) to 51.4%, a direct 11.6% improvement on the chal-

lenging MATH500 benchmark. This result underscores the effectiveness of PQM in capturing the

relative quality of different steps within a trajectory, addressing the limitations of BCE loss which

treats each step independently without considering their interdependencies. PQM outperforms MSE

loss with either 0-1 label or MCTS search. Compared to 0-1 label, MCTS search requires more

computational resources but only leads to marginal performance enhancement. This may stem from

its Q-value definition with sophisticated heuristics, and theoretically biased estimation of Q-values

in MCTS. Other results on both the MATH500 and GSM-Plus datasets across three policy models

further confirm the efficacy of PQM. In these benchmarks, PQM consistently outperforms existing

methods, demonstrating superior performance across different policy scales and test sets, validating

the efficacy of ranking-based process reward modeling.

PQM performance can be boosted by self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023b).

By sampling mul-

tiple trajectories and then selecting the final answer that appears most frequently, self-consistency

can further enhance the reliability of LLMs. In Figure 2, we report performance when combining

self-consistency with our method PQM under both ζ = 2 and ζ = 4. This integration capitalizes on

the strengths of self-consistency to further enhance the verification. The performance gap between

PQM and SC+PQM increases as we move to the right in Figure 2, since the large capacity model

tends to reinforce the effectiveness of SC, leading to the increased performance gap observed in the

figure. Our results reveal that this combination can boost performance, underscoring that blending

self-consistency with process reward modeling provides a more effective verification strategy.

PQM remains effective under different LLM backbones.

To explore the generalization of our

approach, we train with PQM on additional LLM backbones, including Qwen2-Math-1.5B, Qwen2-

Math-1.5B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), Deepseek-Math-7B-rl (Shao et al., 2024), Metamath-7B and

Metamath-13B (Yu et al., 2024). As shown in Table 2, stronger backbones generally lead to better

overall performance under the same sampling policy model. Moreover, Qwen2-Math-1.5B-Instruct

achieves impressive results among six backbones, which indicates that a small-scale PQM can also

provide effective verification if the backbone is specialized in mathematics.

## Further Studies

In ablation studies, we keep most of the experimental settings consistent with the main experiments,

except that we use data with a length of less than 512 tokens, totaling 390k data out of 440k data, to

save the training cost. The detailed hyperparameters are shown in Appendix B.

Impact of margin ζ. In this ablation, we investigate how the margin ζ in our loss function influ-

ences the performance. We implement several variations with ζ = 0, 2, 4, 8, 16. The experimental

results are shown in Table 3, along with loss curves in Figure 5 (Appendix). Our experiments reveal

that ζ has a minimal effect on the convergence of training, as the loss curves for all values flatten out

after approximately 200 steps. However, the choice of ζ impacts the effectiveness of our method.

As shown in Table 3, extreme values of ζ—either too large or too small—lead to suboptimal perfor-

mance. Specifically, ζ values of 2,4,8 yield the best results, whereas ζ values of 0 and 16 perform

less effectively. When ζ is too large, the comparative loss overweighs the discrepancy between the

correct steps and wrong steps while neglecting the ascending relationship among Q-values of cor-

rect steps. Conversely, when ζ is too small, the loss function fails to adequately capture Q-value

discrepancies, leading to suboptimal performance. These findings align with our theoretical expec-

tations and underscore the importance of choosing an appropriate ζ to balance the comparative loss

and capture meaningful Q-value distinctions.

Impact of loss design. Since the empirical training dataset automatically marks all steps after the

first incorrect one as negative steps, we ablate the impact of these pseudo-negative steps by compar-

ing our loss function with the theoretical version as delineated in Eq. 9. The findings, presented in

Table 3, reveal the existence of noise in negative annotations. Specifically, when applying the theo-

retical loss as in Eq. 9, there is a marked decline in performance. We also explored another variant

that emphasize the first negative step since the first negative annotation is verified by the automatic

annotation. The experimental results and analysis are supplemented in Appendix C.

Empirical validation of Assumption 3.1 and Theorem 3.5.

To empirically validate the Assump-

tion 3.1 and Theorem 3.5, we use Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct to substitute the optimal model π∗. We

sample 256 trajectories from Math-Step-DPO-10K (Lai et al., 2024), each consisting of more than

six steps. For each step ai in each trajectory, we sample 32 times by τ ∼π∗(·|a1:i). In Fig. 3, the

left panel’s y-axis shows the proportion of correct next steps, while the right panel’s y-axis displays

the proportion of correct trajectories. The x-axis indicates whether the generation is conditioned

on a correct state or an incorrect state. The plot demonstrates that when conditioned on a correct

reasoning state, there is a higher probability of generating a correct subsequent step or completing

a correct trajectory. This validates our Assumption 3.1. In Fig. 4, x-axis represents the i-th correct

step (left) or wrong step (right), and y-axis represents the approximated Qσ. According to the graph,

the approximated Q-values ascend with the continuation of the correct steps. Meanwhile, the latter

wrong steps generally have smaller Q-values than the previous wrong steps. Moreover, there is a

noticeable discrepancy between Q-value of correct steps (generally over 0.5) and incorrect steps

(generally below 0.15). Implementation details and more discussions can be found in Appendix C.

Qualitative example.

For each step in the solution, we display the predicted probability of achiev-

ing the correct final answer by ORM, classification-based PRM, and PQM in Table 4. We also show

the original Q value predicted by PQM, along with Qσ = σ(Q). The Q-value predicted by PQM

## Related Works

Process Reward Models. Process supervision (Uesato et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b), represented

by PRMs, can provide more precise feedback, which is easier for humans to interpret, and more

directly rewards models in step-by-step reasoning tasks. Most existing research (Lightman et al.,

2024; Wang et al., 2023a; Shao et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024) formulates PRM as a classification

problem, where the process reward is modeled as the probability of correctness of each step. We

show that the prior approach can be cast as a special case under our theoretical framework. Due to

the labor-intensive nature of dense annotations, several recent methods have introduced automatic

annotation strategies (Wang et al., 2023a; Luo et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024a). In these approaches, a

step is deemed correct if a valid completion can be sampled from the LLM policy within k trials, see

details in Appendix A. Generally, the subsequent steps after the first error are all treated as wrong

steps in this line of methods. Additionally, Zhang et al. (2024a); Wang et al. (2024) estimate the Q-

value of intermediate steps by iterative Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and MSE loss. However,

their Q-value designs are different from ours, which generally incorporate sophisticated heuristics,

e.g., reasoning distance and quality value. Moreover, their works necessitate a dense online search

over the large action space. Besides being costly, the distribution shift between the sampling policy

and the optimal π∗will result in biased estimation. In contrast, our comparative loss is easy to use,

and can achieve unbiased estimation according to our theory. For completeness, we document the

automatic annotation pipeline and more related research about PRM in Appendix A.

MDP RL for LLMs. Although the outcome reward model has advanced LLMs by applying re-

inforcement learning algorithms in bandit settings, it contradicts the auto-regressive nature of text

generation and the step-by-step reasoning process. Recent studies (Rafailov et al., 2024a; Zhong

et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024) introduced theoretically sound RL algorithms de-

signed for LLMs in MDP settings. Although these efforts bridge the theoretical discrepancy in

algorithms, they still rely, at least partially, on ORMs. Hence, the process reward model remains

underexplored in MDP-based RL for LLMs. Orthogonal to our exploration, several works (Lu et al.,

2024b; Lai et al., 2024; Chen et al.; Zhang et al., 2024b) adapt DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024b) to

step-level preference optimization for reasoning tasks. We discuss the potential of integrating such

methods into our framework in Appendix D.

## Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce the Process Q-value Model (PQM), a new approach to model process re-

wards via optimization Q-value ranking. Unlike existing classification-based methods, which treat

intermediate steps independently, PQM captures the interdependencies among steps. To effectively

optimize the Q-value rankings, we propose a margin-based comparative training objective and vali-

date its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments. Our results demonstrate that PQM signif-

icantly outperforms previous baselines, achieving an 11.6% accuracy improvement when verifying

solutions generated by LLama-3-70B-Instruction on the MATH500 dataset, and consistently deliv-

ering robust results across various backbone scales, policy models, and datasets. We hope our work

inspires more future investigation on process reward modeling that better captures the complexities

of multi-step reasoning processes.

## Related Works

Several techniques have been developed to accelerate the data collection pipeline for training PRMs

(Luo et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024a). To simplify understanding, we first introduce the fundamental

version proposed in Wang et al. (2023a). In this approach, the quality of an intermediate step is

evaluated based on its potential to lead to the correct final answer. The pipeline can be summarized

as follows:

• For a given question x ∼ρ, several trajectories are sampled by an LLM: τ1, · · · , τN ∼

π1(·|x). Each trajectory τ = {a1, a2, . . . , aH} consists of a sequence of steps, and the

correctness of these steps is annotated through the following procedure.

• For a trajectory τ = {a1, a2, . . . , aH}, we generate n completions for each step from a1 to

an. Specifically, to annotate ai, we sample n completions by π2(·|x, a1:i). The correctness

of each completion is evaluated by final answer string matching.

• For each step ai, if any completion of it achieves the correct final answer. We regard ai as

correct, otherwise wrong. If ai is wrong, the subsequent steps ai+1, · · · , an are all regarded

as incorrect.

There have been several research trying to promote the pipeline efficiency. For example, Lu et al.

(2024a) trains an additional confidence module to simplify the automatic annotations, Luo et al.

(2024) performs a binary search to identify the first error location.

## Implementation Details

All training is conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs.

We list the ver-

sions

of

the

important

external

packages

as

follows:

torch==2.3.1,

trl==0.8.0,

flashattn==2.6.2,

transformers==4.34.0,

accelerate==0.33.0,

deepspeed==0.13.1,

nvidia-nccl-cu12==2.20.5.

We use the ZeRO-3 optimization stage of the deepspeed with

bfloat16 precision. The hyperparameters for the ablation studies are provided in Table 5, and each

training session for the ablation study took approximately 4.5 hours. For the main experiments,

some training data has tokenized sequences longer than 2048 tokens, which limited the batch size

and reduced training efficiency. To address this, we divide the training corpus into three groups

based on tokenized length: sequences shorter than 512 tokens, between 512 and 1024 tokens,

and greater than 1024 tokens. The batch sizes were set to 64, 24, and 8, respectively, for these

groups. This strategy reduced the training time from about eleven hours to six hours. To generate

the trajectories for Best-of-n sampling, we use the VLLM pipeline with the temperature set to 1,

top-p set to 1, and max length set to 2048. For the MCTS baseline, we fix the policy model as

Qwen2-math-7B-Instruct, and utilize iterative MCTS search to train PRM. For a fair comparison,

we use half of the Math-Shepherd corpus and its hard-estimated labels to construct DV0 (refer to the

original paper (Zhang et al., 2024a)), and train an initial PRM. Then we conduct an MCTS search

on questions of the remaining corpus. To keep the scale of the training set the same, we randomly

sample trajectories with the quantity of 1/2 Math-Shepherd from the MCTS tree.

Comparison with ceiling performance.

We evaluate the ceil-

ing performance of various policy models and compare how PQM

stands against this benchmark. Figure 6 presents the Pass@N met-

ric alongside the best achievable verification performance for three

distinct policy models. This comparison illustrates the upper limits

of verification accuracy for each policy model and highlights the

existing performance gaps. Specifically, the comparison suggests

that current PRMs, including PQM, have not yet reached their full

potential. These findings underscore the need for further advance-

ments and refinements in PRM techniques to close the gap and ap-

proach the ceiling performance more closely.

jectories from Math-Step-DPO-10K (Lai et al., 2024), comprising

128 correct and 128 incorrect trajectories respectively. Each tra-

jectory consists of more than six steps. If the reasoning state is included in a rejected answer, we

regard this reasoning state as incorrect. For each reasoning state a1:i in each trajectory, we sample

32 completions with τ ∼π∗(a1:i). The correctness of next-step ai+1 is annotated automatically as

in Wang et al. (2023a) with Qwen2-Math-Instruct-7B. We use statistics after the fifth step to avoid

Qwen2-Math-Instruct-7B having a larger possibility to self-correct the step, hence misleading the

label. We also count the correctness of each whole trajectory to approximate Qσ for a1:i as defined

in Eq. 2. In Fig. 4, we count the correctness proportionality of correct completions according to the

position i of the reasoning state a1:i. According to the left subgraph of Fig. 4, the approximated

Qσ ascends with the continuation of the correct steps. The right subgraph illustrates that the latter

wrong steps generally have smaller Q-values than the previous wrong steps. Moreover, there is a no-

ticeable discrepancy between the Q-value of correct steps with Qσ generally over 0.5 and incorrect

steps with Qσ generally below 0.15.

PRM-guided beam search.

To further

validate the effectiveness of our PQM,

we have conducted additional experiments

on PRM-guided beam search.

The com-

parison is conducted between PQM and

classification-based PRMs with BCE loss.

We set the beam size as 8, and the gener-

ative temperature as 0.7. The evaluation is

conducted on MATH500 across two policy

models,

Llama-3-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta,

2024) and Eurus-7b-sft (Yuan et al., 2024).

The results are reported in Tabel 7, which

demonstrate that PQM can more effectively

guide the LLM to reason. For ablations, we

compare the performance of PQMs trained

with Ltheorem and different ζ values as in

§4.3. We use Eurus-7b-sft as the policy model. The results in Table 8 align with the findings from

the Best-of-N experiments, showing that a sufficiently large range of ζ leads to strong performance

in PRM-guided beam search, with optimal values typically falling in the middle of the range.

Sample-efficiency of PQM.

To examine whether PQM robustly outperforms classification-based

PRM across different dataset sizes, we randomly sample 25%, 50%, 75% of the original dataset

to train PRMs with BCE loss and PQM loss. We keep most of the hyperparameters as in our main

experiments, and set ζ as 4. As shown in Table 9, the results suggest that PQM generally outperforms

BCE on all ranges of data sizes, and is more sample efficient.

We first highlight behavioral dif-

ferences based on the qualitative example in Table 4.

(1) BCE produces probabilities that are

monotonically decreasing for correct steps (step 1: 0.916 →step 2: 0.882 →step 3: 0.848).

This behavior contradicts the desired property established in Theorem 3.5, which proves that values

should increase (rather than decrease) for correct reasoning steps. (2) BCE does not produce a

large transition in values between correct and incorrect steps. For example, in Table 4, the prob-

ability only slightly decreases from 0.848 (step 3) to 0.628 (step 4), failing to sharply differentiate

between correct and incorrect steps. In contrast, our PQM framework produces Q-values with a sig-

nificant drop from correct to incorrect steps, better aligning with the desired behavior. For example,

in Table 4, the Qσ value drops substantially from 0.482 to 0.004 between steps 3 and 4.

Statistically, we conduct an empirical study to confirm whether BCE and PQM result in different

rankings on test steps. We calculate the proportion of solutions where classification-based PRM

and PQM produce the same rankings across steps. In the test set, only 29.18% of solutions shared

the same rankings. Furthermore, when comparing rankings across different solutions for the same

question (Best-of-N results), we observed that 0% of test questions had identical rankings. We

also randomly sample 2048 cases from the training set. Statistically, classification-based PRMs

and PQM yield different ranking behaviors on 62.79% training cases. These statistics indicate a

significant behavioral difference between BCE and PQM.

## Inter-Solution Comparison

The comparison introduced in the main paper can be termed as intra-solution comparison, since

two compared reasoning steps are within a single trajectory. This is partially because of the format

of currently available corpora for PRM, which generally treats a single trajectory as a data point.

Nevertheless, Theorem. 3.5 can seamlessly apply to comparison among different trajectories, i.e.,

inter-solution comparison. For instance, if two trajectories are diverged from t-th step with a com-

mon correct prior a1:t−1, the comparison will proceed between two different t-th steps. Here, we

denote ac

t is the correct one while aw

t is the wrong one. In this setting, we can derive the following

corollary (note that Q represents the optimal Q-function Q∗if no ambiguity.

Corollary D.1 (Q-value ranking for inter-solution comparison). Formally, for two trajectories

with the same correct prior a1:t−1 and ac

t ≻aw

t , the Q-value rankings among these steps are as

follows, Qw

t ≪Q0 < Q1 < · · · < Qt−1 < Qc

t, where Q0 = V (x).

There have been several offline step-level DPO methods (Lu et al., 2024b; Lai et al., 2024; Chen

et al.; Zhang et al., 2024b) concurrent to our research. Though not focused on PRM, their theo-

retical derivations can also be encompassed by the inter-solution comparison as in Corollary D.1.

Moreover, they (Lai et al., 2024) generally only utilize Qw

t ≪Qc

t and discard the ranking relation-

ships among intermediate steps.

Corollary D.2 (Q-value ranking for inter-solution comparison (General Version)). Formally,

for a trajectory τ with successive H step pairs, [(ac

1, aw

1 ), (ac

2, aw

2 ), · · · , (ac

H, aw

H)], where the t-th

step is conditioned on previous correct steps, i.e. at ∼π(·|ac

1:t−1). We have Qw

H < · · · < Qw

2 <

Qw

1 ≪Q0 < Qc

1 < · · · < Qc

t−1 < Qc

H where Q0 = V (x).

Some step-level optimization are based on tree-structured data as in Corollary D.2, however, existing

research (Chen et al.; Zhang et al., 2024b) generally considers each step pair independently, i.e.

Qw

1 < Qc

1, · · · , Qw

H < Qc

H, neglecting the integral Q-value rankings within the tree. We believe

the above corollaries can shed some light on step-level offline optimization.

## E

## Case Studies

We show more qualatative examples in Table 10 and Table 11. We directly report Q∗to show the

value transition. The predicted values generally have a slight increase among correct steps. When

encountering the wrong step, the predicted value will have a sharp decrease.

## F

## Limitations & Future Works

Notably, as shown in Luo et al. (2024), the data quality of Math-shepherd is restricted due to the

noise introduced by automatic annotation. We believe that more advanced datasets could signifi-

cantly improve the verification capabilities of PRMs. As shown in Appendix C, there remains a

considerable gap between the current performance of PRMs and the ceiling performance, under-

scoring the need for further advancements in PRM techniques. Additionally, while PRMs have

garnered increasing research attention, there is a lack of systematic studies on corresponding online

RL algorithms that leverage PRMs. The potential for fully utilizing PRMs in this context remains

largely unexplored.

Question: What is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three

consecutive integers? Correct Answer: 27

Step 1: Do some research about cubes and about consecutive integers. The equation we are

looking for is in the form of x3 = y + (y + 1) + (y + 2). (-1.703125)

Step 2: Add y +(y +1)+(y +2), the sum of the 3 consecutive integers.y+(y+1)+(y+2)=3y+3

(-0.97265625)

Step 3: Make the equations equal to each other.x3 = 3y + 3 (-1.0625)

Step 4: Subtract 3 out of both sides.x3 −3 = 3y (-0.796875)

Step 5: Divide both sides by 3. x3−3

3

= y (-0.79296875)

Step 6: Since y has to be an integer, look for a perfect cube that, when subtracted by 3, it results

in a multiple of 3.Our smallest option is to try 1, but it doesn’t work.Our next option is to try 2,

but it doesn’t work.Our next option is to try 3, but it doesn’t work.Our next option is to try 4,

which results in 61.Our next option is to try 5, which results in 106. (-3.234375)

Step 7: Check which one works. 61 isn’t a multiple of 3, but 106 is. Final Answer: The final

answer is 125. I hope it is correct. (-5.03125)

Step 1: Write an expression for three consecutive integers. Call them a −1, a, and a + 1.

(-0.53515625)

Step 2: Write an expression for their sum. The sum of the three is a −1 + a + a + 1 = 3a.

(-0.302734375)

Step 3: We want this sum to be a perfect cube, so let 3a = n3. Divide both sides by 3 to get

a = n3

3 . (-0.265625)

Step 4: Since we want a to be an integer, it must be that n is a multiple of 3. Therefore, we

have n = 3k, where k is an integer. Substitute this back into a = n3

3 to get a = (3k)3

3

= 32k3.

(-0.33203125)

Step 5: From here, we just guess and check for values of k to find our answer. When k = 1,

then a = 32(1)3 = 9 and a−1 = 8, a = 9, and a+1 = 10. The sum of these three consecutive

integers is 8 + 9 + 10 = 27 = 33. Therefore, the smallest positive perfect cube that can be

written as the sum of three consecutive integers is 27 . Final Answer: The final answer is 27.

I hope it is correct. (-1.6015625)

Step 1: Let n, n + 1, n + 2 be three consecutive integers, such that their sum is equal to k3, a

perfect cube. In other words, n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = k3. (-0.734375)

Step 2: Rearranging the terms in the equation, we obtain: 3n + 3 = k3. (-0.255859375)

Step 3: Substracting 3 from both sides, we get: 3n = k3 −3. (-0.177734375)

Step 4: Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain: n = k3−3

3

. (-0.376953125)

Step 5: Since n must be an integer, then k3 −3 must be divisible by 3. (-0.451171875)

Step 6: Adding 3 to both sides, we get: k3 = k3 −3 + 3, k3 = k3 −3 + 3, k3 = (k3 −3) + 3.

(-2.3125)

Step 7: The smallest perfect cube that is 3 greater than a multiple of 3 is k3 = 64. (-5.46875)

Step 8: Plugging in k3 = 64 to our equation in Step 4, we get: n = 64−3

3

= 61

3 = 20 + 1

3.

(-5.71875)

Step 9: Since n must be an integer, then we must increase k3 to k3 = 125 to get an integer

value of n. (-5.0625)

Step 10: Plugging in k3 = 125 to our equation in Step 4, we get: n =

125−3

3

=

122

3

=

40 + 2

3. (-5.34375)

Step 11: Since n must be an integer, then we must increase k3 to k3 = 216 to get an integer

value of n. (-4.625)

Step 12: Plugging in k3 = 216 to our equation in Step 4, we get: n = 216−3

3

= 213

3

= 71. (-

4.0625)

Step 13: We found an integer value of n, which is our goal. We will not need to increase k3

any further. (-1.8359375)

Step 14: Plugging in n = 71 to our initial equation, we get: 71+72+73 = k3, 216 = k3, k3 =

216. Final Answer: The smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three

consecutive integers is 216. I hope it is correct. (-4.84375)

5. No real solution for x = 3 either.Final

Answer: The final answer is there is no solution. I hope it is correct. (-3.640625)

Step 1: Isolate the radical x −4 =√11 −2x. (-0.251953125)

Step 2: Square both sides (x −4)2 = (√11 −2x)2. (-0.01080322265625)

Step 3: Simplify x2 −8x + 16 = 11 −2x. (-0.022216796875)

Step 4: Write in standard form x2 −6x + 5 = 0. (0.0849609375)

Step 5: Factor (x −5)(x −1) = 0.. (0.1630859375)

Step 6: Solve for x, x = 1, 5 . (-0.44140625)

Step 7: Check solutions: x = 1 is extraneous. Final Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is

correct. (-1.40625)

Step 1: We want to first isolate the square root on the right hand side. Subtract 4 from both

sides to get x −4 =√11 −2x. (0.0390625)

Step 2: Now we square both sides to get(x −4)2 = 11 −2x. (0.09521484375)

Step 3: Multiply out to getx2 −8x + 16 = 11 −2x.(0.2275390625)

Step 4: Move all terms to the left and combine like terms to getx2 −10x + 5 = 0.(-4.375)

Step 5: We now factor the equation to get (x −5)(x −1) = 0.(-4.5)

Step 6: And we solve for x by setting each factor equal to 0: x = 1 or x = 5. Final Answer:

The final answer is x = 1 or x = 5 . I hope it is correct. (-6.5)

Step 1: Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation.x −4 = √11 −2x (-0.296875)

Step 2: Square both sides of the equation.(x −4)2 = 11 −2x (-0.0341796875)

Step 3: Expand and simplify both sides of the equation.x2 −8x + 16 = 11 −2x,x2 −8x +

2x −16 + 11 = 0,x2 −6x −5 = 0,(x −5)(x + 1) = 0 (-4.875)

Step 4: Solve for both values of x.x −5 = 0,x = 5 ,x + 1 = 0,x = −1 (-5.5)
