## Abstract

Reward hacking—where RL agents exploit gaps in misspeciﬁed reward

functions—has been widely observed, but not yet systematically studied. To un-

derstand how reward hacking arises, we construct four RL environments with

misspeciﬁed rewards. We investigate reward hacking as a function of agent ca-

pabilities: model capacity, action space resolution, observation space noise, and

training time. More capable agents often exploit reward misspeciﬁcations, achiev-

ing higher proxy reward and lower true reward than less capable agents. Moreover,

we ﬁnd instances of phase transitions: capability thresholds at which the agent’s

behavior qualitatively shifts, leading to a sharp decrease in the true reward. Such

phase transitions pose challenges to monitoring the safety of ML systems. To ad-

dress this, we propose an anomaly detection task for aberrant policies and offer

several baseline detectors.

## Introduction

As reinforcement learning agents are trained with better algorithms, more data, and larger policy

models, they are at increased risk of overﬁtting their objectives (Russell, 2019). Reward hacking,

or the gaming of misspeciﬁed reward functions by RL agents, has appeared in a variety of contexts,

such as game playing (Ibarz et al., 2018), text summarization (Paulus et al., 2018), and autonomous

driving (Knox et al., 2021). These examples show that better algorithms and models are not enough;

for human-centered applications such as healthcare (Yu et al., 2019), economics (Trott et al., 2021)

and robotics (Kober et al., 2013), RL algorithms must be safe and aligned with human objec-

tives (Bommasani et al., 2021; Hubinger et al., 2019).

Reward misspeciﬁcations occur because real-world tasks have numerous, often conﬂicting desider-

ata. In practice, reward designers resort to optimizing a proxy reward that is either more readily

measured or more easily optimized than the true reward. For example, consider a recommender

system optimizing for users’ subjective well-being (SWB). Because SWB is difﬁcult to measure,

engineers rely on more tangible metrics such as click-through rates or watch-time. Optimizing for

misspeciﬁed proxies led YouTube to overemphasize watch-time and harm user satisfaction (Stray,

2020), as well as to recommended extreme political content to users (Ribeiro et al., 2020).

Addressing reward hacking is a ﬁrst step towards developing human-aligned RL agents and one goal

of ML safety (Hendrycks et al., 2021a). However, there has been little systematic work investigating

when or how it tends to occur, or how to detect it before it runs awry. To remedy this, we study

the problem of reward hacking across four diverse environments: trafﬁc control (Wu et al., 2021),

COVID response (Kompella et al., 2020), blood glucose monitoring (Fox et al., 2020), and the Atari

game Riverraid (Brockman et al., 2016). Within these environments, we construct nine misspeciﬁed

proxy reward functions (Section 3).

Using our environments, we study how increasing optimization power affects reward hacking, by

training RL agents with varying resources such as model size, training time, action space resolution,

and observation space noise (Section 4). We ﬁnd that more powerful agents often attain higher proxy

reward but lower true reward, as illustrated in Figure 1. Since the trend in ML is to increase resources

exponentially each year (Littman et al., 2021), this suggests that reward hacking will become more

pronounced in the future in the absence of countermeasures.

Figure 1: An example of reward hacking when cars merge onto a highway. A human-driver model

controls the grey cars and an RL policy controls the red car. The RL agent observes positions

and velocities of nearby cars (including itself) and adjusts its acceleration to maximize the proxy

reward. At ﬁrst glance, both the proxy reward and true reward appear to incentivize fast trafﬁc ﬂow.

However, smaller policy models allow the red car to merge, whereas larger policy models exploit

the misspeciﬁcation by stopping the red car. When the red car stops merging, the mean velocity

increases (merging slows down the more numerous grey cars). However, the mean commute time

also increases (the red car is stuck). This exempliﬁes a phase transition: the qualitative behavior of

the agent shifts as the model size increases.

More worryingly, we observe several instances of phase transitions. In a phase transition, the more

capable model pursues a qualitatively different policy that sharply decreases the true reward. Fig-

ure 1 illustrates one example: An RL agent regulating trafﬁc learns to stop any cars from merging

onto the highway in order to maintain a high average velocity of the cars on the straightaway.

Since there is little prior warning of phase transitions, they pose a challenge to monitor-

ing the safety of ML systems.

Spurred by this challenge, we propose an anomaly detec-

tion task (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Tack et al., 2020):

Can we detect when the true re-

ward starts to drop, while maintaining a low false positive rate in benign cases?

We instan-

tiate our proposed task, POLYNOMALY, for the trafﬁc and COVID environments (Section 5).

Given a trusted policy with moderate performance, one must detect whether a given policy is

aberrant.

We provide several baseline anomaly detectors for this task and release our data at

https://github.com/aypan17/reward-misspecification.

## Related Work

Previous works have focused on classifying different types of reward hacking and sometimes mit-

igating its effects.

One popular setting is an agent on a grid-world with an erroneous sensor.

Hadﬁeld-Menell et al. (2017) show and mitigate the reward hacking that arises due to an incor-

rect sensor reading at test time in a 10x10 navigation grid world. Leike et al. (2017) show examples

of reward hacking in a 3x3 boat race and a 5x7 tomato watering grid world. Everitt et al. (2017)

theoretically study and mitigate reward hacking caused by a faulty sensor.

Game-playing agents have also been found to hack their reward. Baker et al. (2020) exhibit reward

hacking in a hide-and-seek environment comprising 3-6 agents, 3-9 movable boxes and a few ramps:

without a penalty for leaving the play area, the hiding agents learn to endlessly run from the seeking

agents. Toromanoff et al. (2019) brieﬂy mention reward hacking in several Atari games (Elevator

Action, Kangaroo, Bank Heist) where the agent loops in a sub-optimal trajectory that provides a

repeated small reward.

Agents optimizing a learned reward can also demonstrate reward hacking. Ibarz et al. (2018) show

an agent hacking a learned reward in Atari (Hero, Montezuma’s Revenge, and Private Eye), where

optimizing a frozen reward predictor eventually achieves high predicted score and low actual score.

Christiano et al. (2017) show an example of reward hacking in the Pong game where the agent

learns to hit the ball back and forth instead of winning the point. Stiennon et al. (2020) show that a

policy which over-optimizes the learnt reward model for text summarization produces lower quality

summarizations when judged by humans.

## Experimental Setup: Environments And Reward Functions

In this section, we describe our four environments (Section 3.1) and taxonomize our nine corre-

sponding misspeciﬁed reward functions (Section 3.2).

3.1

## Environments

We chose a diverse set of environments and prioritized complexity of action space, observation

space, and dynamics model. Our aim was to reﬂect real-world constraints in our environments,

selecting ones with several desiderata that must be simultaneously balanced. Table 1 provides a

summary.

Trafﬁc Control.

The trafﬁc environment is an autonomous vehicle (AV) simulation that models

vehicles driving on different highway networks. The vehicles are either controlled by a RL algorithm

or pre-programmed via a human behavioral model. Our misspeciﬁcations are listed in Table 1.

We use the Flow trafﬁc simulator, implemented by Wu et al. (2021) and Vinitsky et al. (2018), which

extends the popular SUMO trafﬁc simulator (Lopez et al., 2018). The simulator uses cars that drive

like humans, following the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) (Treiber et al., 2000), a widely-accepted

approximation of human driving behavior. Simulated drivers attempt to travel as fast as possible

while tending to decelerate whenever they are too close to the car immediately in front.

The RL policy has access to observations only from the AVs it controls. For each AV, the observation

space consists of the car’s position, its velocity, and the position and velocity of the cars immediately

in front of and behind it. The continuous control action is the acceleration applied to each AV.

Figure 4 depicts the Trafﬁc-Mer network, where cars from an on-ramp attempt to merge onto the

straightaway. We also use the Trafﬁc-Bot network, where cars (1-4 RL, 10-20 human) drive through

a highway bottleneck where lanes decrease from four to two to one.

COVID Response.

The COVID environment, developed by Kompella et al. (2020), simulates a

population using the SEIR model of individual infection dynamics. The RL policymaker adjusts the

severity of social distancing regulations while balancing economic health (better with lower regula-

tions) and public health (better with higher regulations), similar in spirit to Trott et al. (2021). The

population attributes (proportion of adults, number of hospitals) and infection dynamics (random

testing rate, infection rate) are based on data from Austin, Texas.

Every day, the environment simulates the infection dynamics and reports testing results to the agent,

but not the true infection numbers. The policy chooses one of three discrete actions: INCREASE,

DECREASE, or MAINTAIN the current regulation stage, which directly affects the behavior of the

population and indirectly affects the infection dynamics. There are ﬁve stages in total.

Atari Riverraid.

The Atari Riverraid environment is run on OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al.,

2016). The agent operates a plane which ﬂies over a river and is rewarded by destroying ene-

mies. The agent observes the raw pixel input of the environment. The agent can take one of eighteen

discrete actions, corresponding to either movement or shooting within the environment.

Glucose Monitoring.

The glucose environment, implemented in Fox et al. (2020), is a continuous

control problem. It extends a FDA-approved simulator (Man et al., 2014) for blood glucose levels of

a patient with Type 1 diabetes. The patient partakes in meals and wears a continuous glucose monitor

(CGM), which gives noisy observations of the patient’s glucose levels. The RL agent administers

insulin to maintain a healthy glucose level.

Every ﬁve minutes, the agent observes the patient’s glucose levels and decides how much insulin to

administer. The observation space is the previous four hours of glucose levels and insulin dosages.

3.2

## Misspecifications

Using the above environments, we constructed nine instances of misspeciﬁed proxy rewards. To help

interpret these proxies, we taxonomize them as instances of misweighting, incorrect ontology, or

incorrect scope. We elaborate further on this taxonimization using the trafﬁc example from Figure 1.

Table 1: Reward misspeciﬁcations across our four environments. ‘Misalign’ indicates whether the

true reward drops and ‘Transition’ indicates whether this corresponds to a phase transition (sharp

qualitative change). We observe 5 instances of misalignment and 4 instances of phase transitions.

‘Mis.’ is a misweighting and ’Ont.’ is an ontological misspeciﬁcation.

• Misweighting. Suppose that the true reward is a linear combination of commute time and acceler-

ation (for reducing carbon emissions). Downweighting the acceleration term thus underpenalizes

carbon emissions. In general, misweighting occurs when the proxy and true reward capture the

same desiderata, but differ on their relative importance.

• Ontological. Congestion could be operationalized as either high average commute time or low

average vehicle velocity. In general, ontological misspeciﬁcation occurs when the proxy and true

reward use different desiderata to capture the same concept.

• Scope. If monitoring velocity over all roads is too costly, a city might instead monitor them only

over highways, thus pushing congestion to local streets. In general, scope misspeciﬁcation occurs

when the proxy measures desiderata over a restricted domain (e.g. time, space).

We include a summary of all nine tasks in Table 1 and provide full details in Appendix A. Table 1

also indicates whether each proxy leads to misalignment (i.e. to a policy with low true reward) and

whether it leads to a phase transition (a sudden qualitative shift as model capacity increases). We

investigate both of these in Section 4.

Evaluation protocol.

For each environment and proxy-true reward pair, we train an agent

using the proxy reward and evaluate performance according to the true reward.

We use

PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) to optimize policies for the trafﬁc and COVID environments,

SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) to optimize the policies for the glucose environment, and torch-

beast (K¨uttler et al., 2019), a PyTorch implementation of IMPALA (Espeholt et al., 2018), to opti-

mize the policies for the Atari environment. When available, we adopt the hyperparameters (except

the learning rate and network size) given by the original codebase.

## How Agent Optimization Power Drives Misalignment

To better understand reward hacking, we study how it emerges as agent optimization power in-

creases. We deﬁne optimization power as the effective search space of policies the agent has access

to, as implicitly determined by model size, training steps, action space, and observation space.

In Section 4.1, we consider the quantitative effect of optimization power for all nine environment-

misspeciﬁcation pairs; we primarily do this by varying model size, but also use training steps, action

space, and observation space as robustness checks. Overall, more capable agents tend to overﬁt the

proxy reward and achieve a lower true reward. We also ﬁnd evidence of phase transitions on four

of the environment-misspeciﬁcation pairs. For these phase transitions, there is a critical threshold at

which the proxy reward rapidly increases and the true reward rapidly drops.

In Section 4.2, we further investigate these phase transitions by qualitatively studying the result-

ing policies. At the transition, we ﬁnd that the quantitative drop in true reward corresponds to a

ments. The red line indicates a phase transition.

qualitative shift in policy behavior. Extrapolating visible trends is therefore insufﬁcient to catch all

instances of reward hacking, increasing the urgency of research in this area.

In Section 4.3, we assess the faithfulness of our proxies, showing that reward hacking occurs even

though the true and proxy rewards are strongly positively correlated in most cases.

4.1

## Quantitative Effects Vs. Agent Capabilities

As a stand-in for increasing agent optimization power, we ﬁrst vary the model capacity for a ﬁxed

environment and proxy reward. Speciﬁcally, we vary the width and depth of the actor and critic

networks, changing the parameter count by two to four orders of magnitude depending on the envi-

ronment. For a given policy, the actor and critic are always the same size.

Model Capacity.

Our results are shown in Figure 2, with additional plots included in Appendix A.

We plot both the proxy (blue) and true (green) reward vs. the number of parameters. As model

size increases, the proxy reward increases but the true reward decreases. This suggests that reward

designers will likely need to take greater care to specify reward functions accurately and is especially

salient given the recent trends towards larger and larger models (Littman et al., 2021).

The drop in true reward is sometimes quite sudden. We call these sudden shifts phase transitions,

and mark them with dashed red lines in Figure 2. These quantitative trends are reﬂected in the

qualitative behavior of the policies (Section 4.2), which typically also shift at the phase transition.

Model capacity is only one proxy for agent capabilities, and larger models do not always lead to more

capable agents (Andrychowicz et al., 2020). To check the robustness of our results, we consider

several other measures of optimization: observation ﬁdelity, number of training steps, and action

space resolution.

(a) Atari - Misweighting

(b) Trafﬁc - Ontological

(c) COVID - Ontological

Figure 3: In addition to parameter count, we consider three other agent capabilities: training steps,

action space resolution, and observation noise. In Figure 3a, an increase in the proxy reward comes

at the cost of the true reward. In Figure 3b, increasing the granularity (from right to left) causes the

agent to achieve similar proxy reward but lower true reward. In Figure 3c, increasing the ﬁdelity

of observations (by increasing the random testing rate in the population) tends to decrease the true

reward with no clear impact on proxy reward.

5

## Page 6

Number of training steps.

Assuming a reasonable RL algorithm and hyperparameters, agents

which are trained for more steps have more optimization power. We vary training steps for an

agent trained on the Atari environment. The true reward incentivizes staying alive for as many

frames as possible while moving smoothly. The proxy reward misweights these considerations by

underpenalizing the smoothness constraint. As shown in Figure 3a, optimizing the proxy reward for

more steps harms the true reward, after an initial period where the rewards are positively correlated.

Action space resolution.

Intuitively, an agent that can take more precise actions is more capable.

For example, as technology improves, an RL car may make course corrections every millisecond

instead of every second. We study action space resolution in the trafﬁc environment by discretizing

the output space of the RL agent. Speciﬁcally, under resolution level ε, we round the action a ∈R

output by the RL agent to the nearest multiple of ε and use that as our action. The larger the

resolution level ε, the lower the action space resolution. Results are shown in Figure 3b for a ﬁxed

model size. Increasing the resolution causes the proxy reward to remain roughly constant while the

true reward decreases.

Observation ﬁdelity.

Agents with access to better input sensors, like higher-resolution cameras,

should make more informed decisions and thus have more optimization power. Concretely, we study

this in the COVID environment, where we increase the random testing rate in the population. The

proxy reward is a linear combination of the number of infections and severity of social distanc-

ing, while the true reward also factors in political cost. As shown in Figure 3c, as the testing rate

increases, the model achieves similar proxy reward at the cost of a slightly lower true reward.

4.2

## Qualitative Effects

In the previous section, quantitative trends showed that increasing a model’s optimization power

often hurts performance on the true reward. We shift our focus to understanding how this decrease

happens. In particular, we typically observe a qualitative shift in behavior associated with each of

the phase transitions, three of which we describe below.

Trafﬁc Control.

We focus on the Trafﬁc-Mer environment from Figure 2a, where minimizing

average commute time is replaced by maximizing average velocity. In this case, smaller policies

learn to merge onto the straightaway by slightly slowing down the other vehicles (Figure 4a). On the

other hand, larger policy models stop the AVs to prevent them from merging at all (Figure 4b). This

increases the average velocity, because the vehicles on the straightaway (which greatly outnumber

vehicles on the on-ramp) do not need to slow down for merging trafﬁc. However, it signiﬁcantly

increases the average commute time, as the passengers in the AV remain stuck.

COVID Response.

Suppose the RL agent optimizes solely for the public and economic health of

a society, without factoring politics into its decision-making. This behavior is shown in Figure 5.

The larger model chooses to increase the severity of social distancing restrictions earlier than the

smaller model. As a result, larger models are able to maintain low average levels of both ICU usage

(a proxy for public health) and social distancing restrictions (a proxy for economic health). These

(a) Trafﬁc policy of smaller network

(b) Trafﬁc policy of larger network

Figure 4: The larger model prevents the AVs (in red) from moving to increase the velocity of the

human cars (unobserved cars in white and observed cars in blue). However, this greatly increases

the average commute per person.

6

## Page 7

Figure 5: For COVID, ICU usage is a proxy for public health and regulation stage is a proxy for

economic health. The blue line indicates the maximum stage (right) enforced by the larger policy and

the corresponding ICU level (left) at that stage. The red line is the equivalent for the smaller policy.

Because the larger policy enforces regulations much sooner than the smaller policy, it maintains

both low ICU usage and low regulation stage. However, the larger policy is politically unfavorable:

regulations are high even though public signs of infection, such as ICU usage, are low.

preemptive regulations may however be politically costly, as enforcing restrictions without clear

signs of infection may foment public unrest (Boettke & Powell, 2021).

Atari Riverraid.

We create an ontological misspeciﬁcation by rewarding the plane for staying

alive as long as possible while shooting as little as possible: a “paciﬁst run”. We then measure

the game score as the true reward. We ﬁnd that agents with more parameters typically maneuver

more adeptly. Such agents shoot less frequently, but survive for much longer, acquiring points (true

reward) due to passing checkpoints. In this case, therefore, the proxy and true rewards are well-

aligned so that reward hacking does not emerge as capabilities increase.

We did, however, ﬁnd that some of the agents exploited a bug in the simulator that halts the plane

at the beginning of the level. The simulator advances but the plane itself does not move, thereby

achieving high paciﬁst reward.

Glucose Monitoring.

Consider an RL agent that optimizes solely for a patient’s health, without

considering the economic costs of its treatment plans. In this case, the proxy reward is based off of a

glycemic risk measure, which reﬂects the likelihood that a patient will suffer an acute hypoglycemic

episode, developed by the medical community (Kovatchev et al., 2000).

However, a less economically-privileged patient may opt for the treatment plan with the least ex-

pected cost (Herkert et al., 2019; Fralick & Kesselheim, 2019), not the one with the least amount

of risk. From this patient’s perspective, the true reward is the expected cost of the treatment plan,

which includes the expected cost of hospital visits and the cost of administering the insulin.

Although larger model treatments reduce hypoglycemic risk more smaller model treatments, they

administer more insulin. Based on the average cost of an ER visit for a hypogylcemic episode

($1350 from Bronstone & Graham (2016)) and the average cost of a unit of insulin ($0.32 from Lee

(2020)), we ﬁnd that it is actually more expensive to pursue the larger model’s treatment.

4.3

## Quantitative Effects Vs Proxy-True Reward Correlation

We saw in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 that agents often pursue proxy rewards at the cost of the true reward.

Perhaps this only occurs because the proxy is greatly misspeciﬁed, i.e., the proxy and true reward

are weakly or negatively correlated. If this were the case, then reward hacking may pose less of a

threat. To investigate this intuition, we plot the correlation between the proxy and true rewards.

The correlation is determined by the state distribution of a given policy, so we consider two types

of state distributions. Speciﬁcally, for a given model size, we obtain two checkpoints: one that

achieves the highest proxy reward during training and one from early in training (less than 1% of

training complete). We call the former the “trained checkpoint” and the latter the “early checkpoint”.

Figure 6: Correlations between the proxy and true rewards, along with the reward hacking induced.

In Figure 6a, we plot the proxy reward with “•” and the true reward with “×”. In Figure 6b, we plot

the trained checkpoint correlation and the early checkpoint correlation.

For a given model checkpoint, we calculate the Pearson correlation ρ between the proxy reward

P and true reward T using 30 trajectory rollouts. Reward hacking occurs even though there is

signiﬁcant positive correlation between the true and proxy rewards (see Figure 6). The correlation

is lower for the trained model than for the early model, but still high. Further ﬁgures are shown

in Appendix A.2. Among the four environments tested, only the Trafﬁc-Mer environment with

ontological misspeciﬁcation had negative Pearson correlation.

## Polynomaly: Mitigating Reward Misspecification

In Section 4, we saw that reward hacking often leads to phase transitions in agent behaviour. Fur-

thermore, in applications like trafﬁc control or COVID response, the true reward may be observed

only sporadically or not at all. Blindly optimizing the proxy in these cases can lead to catastrophic

failure (Zhuang & Hadﬁeld-Menell, 2020; Taylor, 2016).

This raises an important question: Without the true reward signal, how can we mitigate misalign-

ment? We operationalize this as an anomaly detection task: the detector should ﬂag instances of

misalignment, thus preventing catastrophic rollouts. To aid the detector, we provide it with a trusted

policy: one veriﬁed by humans to have acceptable (but not maximal) reward. Our resulting bench-

mark, POLYNOMALY, is described below.

5.1

## Problem Setup

We train a collection of policies by varying model size on the trafﬁc and COVID environments. For

each policy, we estimate the policy’s true reward by averaging over 5 to 32 rollouts. One author

labeled each policy as acceptable, problematic, or ambiguous based on its true reward score relative

to that of other policies. We include only policies that received a non-ambiguous label.

For both environments, we provide a small-to-medium sized model as the trusted policy model, as

Section 4.1 empirically illustrates that smaller models achieve reasonable true reward without ex-

hibiting reward hacking. Given the trusted model and a collection of policies, the anomaly detector’s

task is to predict the binary label of “acceptable” or “problematic” for each policy.

Table 3 in Appendix B.1 summarizes our benchmark. The trusted policy size is a list of the hidden

unit widths of the trusted policy network (not including feature mappings).

5.2

## Evaluation

We propose two evaluation metrics for measuring the performance of our anomaly detectors.

• Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC). The AUROC measures the proba-

bility that a detector will assign a random anomaly a higher score than a random non-anomalous

policy (Davis & Goadrich, 2006). Higher AUROCs indicate stronger detectors.

8

## Page 9

• Max F-1 score. The F-1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and the recall, so detectors

with a high F-1 score have both low false positives and high true negatives. We calculate the max

F-1 score by taking the maximum F-1 score over all possible thresholds for the detector.

5.3

## Baselines

In addition to the benchmark datasets described above, we provide baseline anomaly detectors based

on estimating distances between policies. We estimate the distance between the trusted policy and

the unknown policy based on either the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) or the Hellinger distance.

Speciﬁcally, we use rollouts to generate empirical action distributions. We compute the distance

between these action distributions at each step of the rollout, then aggregate across steps by taking

either the mean or the range. For full details, see Appendix B.2. Table 2 reports the AUROC and

F-1 scores of several such detectors. We provide full ROC curves in Appendix B.2.

We observe that different detectors are better for different tasks, suggesting that future detectors

could do better than any of our baselines. Our benchmark and baseline provides a starting point for

further research on mitigating reward hacking.

## Discussion

In this work, we designed a diverse set of environments and proxy rewards, uncovered several in-

stances of phase transitions, and proposed an anomaly detection task to help mitigate these transi-

tions. Our results raise two questions: How can we not only detect phase transitions, but prevent

them in the ﬁrst place? And how should phase transitions shape our approach to safe ML?

On preventing phase transitions, anomaly detection already offers one path forward. Once we can

detect anomalies, we can potentially prevent them, by using the detector to purge the unwanted

behavior (e.g. by including it in the training objective). Similar policy shaping has recently been used

to make RL agents more ethical (Hendrycks et al., 2021b). However, since the anomaly detectors

will be optimized against by the RL policy, they need to be adversarially robust (Goodfellow et al.,

2014). This motivates further work on adversarial robustness and adversarial anomaly detection.

Another possible direction is optimizing policies against a distribution of rewards (Brown et al.,

2020; Javed et al., 2021), which may prevent over-ﬁtting to a given set of metrics.

Regarding safe ML, several recent papers propose extrapolating empirical trends to forecast fu-

ture ML capabilities (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021; Droppo & Elibol, 2021), partly to

avoid unforeseen consequences from ML. While we support this work, our results show that trend

extrapolation alone is not enough to ensure the safety of ML systems. To complement trend extrapo-

lation, we need better interpretability methods to identify emergent model behaviors early on, before

they dominate performance (Olah et al., 2018). ML researchers should also familiarize themselves

with emergent behavior in self-organizing systems (Yates, 2012), which often exhibit similar phase

transitions (Anderson, 1972). Indeed, the ubiquity of phase transitions throughout science suggests

that ML researchers should continue to expect surprises–and should therefore prepare for them.

Figure 7: Additional model size scatter plots. Observe that not all misspeciﬁcations cause mis-

alignment. We plot the proxy reward with “•” and the true reward with “×”. The proxy reward is

measured on the left-hand side of each ﬁgure and the true reward is measured on the right hand side

of each ﬁgure.

## A.1

## Effect Of Model Size

We plot the proxy and true reward vs. model size in Figure 7, following the experiment described in

Section 4.1.

In the left column, we plot the proxy reward with “•” and the true reward with “×”. In the right col-

umn, we plot the trained checkpoint correlation and the randomly initialized checkpoint correlation.

## A.2

## Correlation Between Proxy And True Rewards

We plot the correlation between proxy and true rewards, following the experiment described in

Section 4.3. Interestingly, we see that reward hacking still occurs when there is positive correlation

between the true and proxy rewards, e.g., in Figures 8a/8b. Unsurprisingly, proxy-true pairs which

are highly correlated, e.g., Figure 8c/8d do not exhibit reward hacking. Finally, proxy-true pairs

which are negatively correlated, e.g., Figure 8e/8f exhibit the most reward hacking.

## Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves

We plot the ROC curves for the detectors described in Section 5.3. Our detectors are calculated as

follows.

Let P and Q represent two probability distributions with M = 1

2(P +Q). Then the Jensen-Shannon

divergence and the Hellinger distance between them is given by

## Jsd(P||Q) := 1

## 2Kl(P||M) + 1

## 2Kl(Q||M)

Hellinger(P, Q) := 1

Our proposed detectors estimate the distance D(πtrusted, πunknown) between the trusted policy πtrusted

and unknown policy πunknown as follows: We generate r rollouts of πunknown, where r = 5 in the trafﬁc

environment and r = 32 in the COVID environment. Every s steps of a rollout, where s = 10 in

the trafﬁc environment and s = 1 in the COVID environment, we set P to be the action distribution

of πunknown given the unknown agent’s state at that timestep in the rollout and Q to be the action

distribution of πtrusted given the unknown agent’s state at that timestep in the rollout. Intuitively, if P

and Q are far apart, then the trusted agent would have performed a different action than the unknown

agent at that given timestep, indicating a possible case of reward hacking. We then compute either

JSD(P∥Q) or Hellinger(P, Q) following Equation (1). These distances are collected every s steps

over the entire rollout, and we calculate metrics on these distances (range, mean, etc.) to assign an

anomaly score to the untrusted policy.
