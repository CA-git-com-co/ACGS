Abstract

Language models (LMs) must be both safe and

equitable to be responsibly deployed in prac-

tice. With safety in mind, numerous detoxiﬁ-

cation techniques (e.g., Dathathri et al. 2020;

Krause et al. 2020) have been proposed to mit-

igate toxic LM generations. In this work, we

show that these detoxiﬁcation techniques hurt

equity: they decrease the utility of LMs on

language used by marginalized groups (e.g.,

African-American English and minority iden-

tity mentions). In particular, we perform au-

tomatic and human evaluations of text genera-

tion quality when LMs are conditioned on in-

puts with different dialects and group identi-

ﬁers. We ﬁnd that detoxiﬁcation makes LMs

more brittle to distribution shift, especially on

language used by marginalized groups.

We

identify that these failures stem from detoxi-

ﬁcation methods exploiting spurious correla-

tions in toxicity datasets. Overall, our results

highlight the tension between the controllabil-

ity and distributional robustness of LMs.

Introduction

Recent neural language models (LMs) have shown

enormous improvements in text generation abili-

ties. A key factor behind these improvements is

large training corpora that are collected from on-

line sources (Radford et al., 2019). Unfortunately,

because such corpora are too large to ﬁlter granu-

larly (Roller et al., 2020), they inevitably contain

so-called toxic examples: undesirable language

such as expletives, slurs, or other offensive and

threatening speech. When trained on such data,

LMs inevitably learn to generate toxic text (Hen-

derson et al., 2018; Wallace et al., 2019).

To address this issue, recent work has turned

towards detoxifying LMs: reducing toxic gener-

ations without affecting perplexity or generation

quality on nontoxic inputs. Existing detoxiﬁca-

tion strategies involve techniques such as ﬁnetun-

ing LMs on nontoxic data (Gehman et al., 2020) or

incorporating a toxicity discriminator during de-

coding (Dathathri et al., 2020). Our evaluation of

these techniques shows that they are indeed effec-

tive at mitigating toxicity, but at what cost?

We demonstrate that detoxiﬁcation can hurt

LM utility on language used by minority groups.

Concretely, we evaluate detoxiﬁed LMs on text

with minority identity mentions (e.g., words such

as “gay” or “Muslim”) and surface markers of

African-American English (Green, 2002, AAE).

We ﬁrst show that, compared to text contain-

ing White-Aligned English (WAE), detoxiﬁcation

causes a disproportionately large increase in LM

perplexity on text with AAE and minority iden-

tity mentions. Moreover, increasing the strength

of detoxiﬁcation ampliﬁes this bias.

The same trends hold when evaluating the text

generation quality of LMs using crowdworkers.

When conditioned on WAE text, detoxiﬁed LMs

can roughly maintain the topic, ﬂuency, and style

of an input prompt. However, generation quality

deteriorates when models are conditioned on AAE

text, i.e., detoxiﬁcation hurts an LMs’ ability to

understand and complete AAE text.

We identify that these failures are due to the

use of biased toxic classiﬁcation data. In partic-

ular, toxicity datasets often contain spurious cor-

relations between the toxic label and the presence

of AAE and minority identity mentions (Sap et al.,

2019).

These correlations cause detoxiﬁcation

techniques to steer generations away from AAE

and minority identity mentions because they often

consider these aspects of language to be toxic.

We conclude by outlining concrete harms and

possible solutions to these biases.

With regard

to harms, we argue that biased systems force

marginalized users to code-switch or hide their

identity and that these systems can contribute to

social stigmas. For solutions, we discuss improved

procedures for data annotation and model training

that may help debias detoxiﬁcation techniques.

Figure 2: Stronger detoxiﬁcation leads to increased bias

against AAE text. We vary a hyperparameter (ω in GeDi)

that increases the detoxiﬁcation strength and report the

ratio of AAE perplexity to WAE perplexity. The base-

line model (ω = 0) is approximately three times worse

on AAE; when strongly detoxiﬁed, it performs almost

400 times worse on AAE.

Methods and Experimental Setup

The goal of detoxiﬁcation is to mitigate the fre-

quency of toxic generations (also called hate

speech or offensive language) without affecting an

LM’s utility or generation quality on nontoxic in-

puts. We detoxify models using controllable gen-

eration techniques that steer outputs away from

toxicity.

Following past work (Gehman et al.,

2020; Xu et al., 2020), we use four techniques that

provide state-of-the-art levels of detoxiﬁcation.

2.1

Detoxiﬁcation Techniques

## Dapt

We consider domain-adaptive pretrain-

ing (Gururangan et al., 2020, DAPT), i.e., ﬁnetun-

ing LMs on nontoxic data. This technique aims

to erase an LM’s knowledge of toxicity via catas-

trophic forgetting (McCloskey and Cohen, 1989).

PPLM We consider plug and play language mod-

els (Dathathri et al., 2020, PPLM). Here, we ﬁrst

train a toxicity classiﬁer using the hidden states of

the LM as features. At generation time, the LM’s

hidden states are iteratively updated using a gradi-

ent from the toxicity classiﬁer.

GeDi We consider GeDi (Krause et al., 2020),

which combines the probabilities from the LM

with the probabilities from a second, smaller LM

that is trained on nontoxic data (Krause et al.,

2020). We ﬁnetune GPT-2 small (Radford et al.,

2019) for the second LM.

Filtering Finally, we consider output ﬁltering,

where we generate a ﬁxed number of times (we

use 10) from the LM and return the least toxic gen-

eration according to a toxicity classiﬁer. We reuse

the same toxicity classiﬁer from PPLM.

2.2

Hyperparameters and Training Data

We use GPT-2 medium (Radford et al., 2019) as

the base LM for all detoxiﬁcation techniques. We

use the hyperparameters from the original papers

for each technique, except we generate using top-

k sampling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 50 for all

methods to enable a fair comparison.

For training data, we use the commonly-studied

English Jigsaw Civil Comments dataset.1 We re-

move examples where between 10% and 50% of

the annotations are the toxic label (i.e., examples

with low inter-annotator agreement). We publicly

release our code.2

Detoxifying LMs Introduces Biases

In this section, we evaluate the detoxiﬁcation

methods and show that they introduce biases into

LMs that may harm marginalized groups.

Figure 3: We use the detoxiﬁed LMs to generate completions of WAE or AAE prompts. We ask crowdworkers

to compare the generations to those from a baseline GPT-2 model. Detoxiﬁcation methods cause a degradation

in generation quality (topicality, ﬂuency, and style) when models are conditioned on WAE texts. Worse yet,

generation quality is noticeably worse when conditioned on AAE texts, demonstrating unwanted biases. See

Table 1 for qualitative examples.

3.1

Automatic Evaluation Using Perplexity

We ﬁrst perform intrinsic evaluations of each

detoxiﬁcation technique by computing the per-

plexity of detoxiﬁed models on various datasets.

Note that we are not generating from the LM in

this evaluation.3

White-Aligned English Perplexity We ﬁrst eval-

uate the perplexity on White-Aligned English

(WAE) text that is either toxic or nontoxic. We

use WAE tweets from Groenwold et al. (2020).4

The detoxiﬁcation techniques are effective at re-

moving toxicity: the perplexity on toxic data in-

creases substantially (Figure 1, toxic evaluation

set). All techniques also cause a (smaller) increase

in the perplexity on nontoxic WAE tweets, which

shows that detoxiﬁcation comes at some cost to

the LM’s utility. Part of this increase likely results

from distribution shift: the detoxiﬁcation methods

are trained on comments data, but our evaluation

sets come from Twitter.

Identity Mentions and AAE Perplexity We next

evaluate the perplexity of the detoxiﬁed LMs on

nontoxic language that may be used by marginal-

ized groups. Concretely, we use text that contains

minority identity mentions (e.g., words such as

“gay” or “Muslim”) or surface markers of African-

American English (Green, 2002, AAE). We form

two evaluation sets using tweets. First, we collect

tweets from the Twitter API that contain speciﬁc

3The ﬁltering detoxiﬁcation method has the same perplex-

ity as the baseline LM because it is applied post-decoding.

We do not report it here. For GeDi, we set ω to 0.3 because

the default value of 30 results in nearly inﬁnite perplexities.

4We split this data into toxic and nontoxic sets by scoring

the WAE-AAE pairs using the Perspective API at https://

www.perspectiveapi.com/.

identity mentions.5 Second, we use the nontoxic

data from Groenwold et al. (2020), which are the

AAE equivalents of the nontoxic WAE tweets we

used for the previous evaluation.

We ﬁnd that there is a disproportionately large

increase in LM perplexity on the AAE and mi-

nority identity mention tweets (Figure 1, AAE

and identity mentions). For example, when using

PPLM, the perplexity increases by a factor of 2.1

on nontoxic WAE data and a factor of 4.3 on mi-

nority identity mention data.

Stronger Detoxiﬁcation Ampliﬁes Biases

We

also ﬁnd that stronger detoxiﬁcation ampliﬁes the

gap in perplexity between text with WAE and text

with AAE or minority identity mentions. This oc-

curs for all detoxiﬁcation techniques, for example,

in Figure 2 we vary a parameter in GeDi that in-

creases the degree of detoxiﬁcation (ω). As more

detoxiﬁcation is applied, the ratio of AAE per-

plexity to WAE perplexity increases dramatically,

reaching upwards of 400.

3.2

Human Evaluation of Generation Quality

As an extrinsic evaluation, we measure the gen-

eration quality of each detoxiﬁcation method us-

ing crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

We provide a short prompt as input to the detoxi-

ﬁed LMs and then generate 30 additional tokens.

For the prompts, we tokenize the aforementioned

AAE and WAE tweets and extract the ﬁrst half of

each tweet. We sample 50 prompts from each set

of tweets, producing 100 total prompts. Annota-

5See Appendix A for our word list. We ﬁlter out any toxic

tweets using the Perspective API and randomly select 1,000

of the remaining tweets.

Table 1: Detoxiﬁcation techniques are effective at mitigating toxic completions for most prompts, however, they

often generate low-quality or nonsensical completions for AAE prompts. Above, we provide an input prompt

that is the beginning of a WAE or AAE tweet and generate from the LM with top-k sampling. See Figure 3 for

quantitative results from crowdworker evaluations. We censor vulgar and offensive words.

tors are shown the prompt and asked to select the

better of two model-generated continuations: one

from the baseline GPT-2 model and one from a

randomly selected detoxiﬁcation technique. They

evaluate the model continuations based on toxicity

and three measures of generation quality: topical-

ity, ﬂuency, and style. See Appendix B for screen-

shots of the setup (including concrete deﬁnitions

of topicality, ﬂuency, and style). Each example is

evaluated by three different crowdworkers.

Figure 3 shows the results split by WAE and

AAE prompts, and Table 1 shows examples of

generations.

All detoxiﬁcation methods gener-

ate less toxicity than the baseline GPT-2 model.6

However, this detoxiﬁcation typically comes at a

degradation in generation quality. For example,

more than 80% of annotators found GeDi less top-

ical than the GPT-2 baseline, and all of the tech-

niques except DAPT were rated as less ﬂuent.7

Worse yet, when models are conditioned on

AAE texts (hatched bars in Figure 3), the gener-

ation quality is consistently lower across all met-

rics.

The drop is most signiﬁcant in topicality,

where all detoxiﬁed models prefer to change the

topic when asked to generate text conditioned on

AAE prompts (e.g., GeDi was preferred only half

as often for topicality on AAE prompts than on

WAE prompts).

6Filtering performs poorly because GPT-2 rarely gener-

ates nontoxic continuations of toxic prompts.

7As mentioned in Section 3.1, some of the quality issues

can be attributed to domain shift.

Why Detoxiﬁcation Introduces Biases

In this section, we explain why detoxiﬁcation

causes the utility of LMs to degrade on text that

contains AAE and minority identity mentions.

First, note that all detoxiﬁcation techniques make

use of labeled toxic/nontoxic data. For example,

DAPT uses this data directly: it ﬁnetunes the LM

on nontoxic examples. PPLM, GeDi, and Filter-

ing use this data indirectly: they train a classiﬁer

or LM on the toxicity data and then incorporate

this model into the LM’s decoding strategy.

Unfortunately, there are spurious correlations

between the toxic label and the presence of AAE

and minority identity mentions (Sap et al., 2019;

Dixon et al., 2018). These correlations arise from

annotation and sampling biases. Annotation bias

occurs because crowdworkers are often unfamil-

iar with AAE and consequently misjudge it as

toxic (Sap et al., 2019). Sampling bias occurs be-

cause many toxic comments are directed towards

marginalized groups (RWJF, 2017). The result of

these two biases is that text which contains AAE

and minority identity mentions is labeled as toxic

at disproportionately high rates (Sap et al., 2019).

Detoxiﬁcation techniques inherit these undesir-

able biases. For example, DAPT will train LMs

to not only forget toxicity but also forget AAE and

minority identity mentions. Similarly, the discrim-

inators used by PPLM, GeDi, and Filtering will

guide the generated text away from AAE and iden-

tity mentions because the discriminators typically

consider such text as toxic (Dixon et al., 2018; Sap

et al., 2019; Oliva et al., 2020). Also note that in

all of the above cases, increasing the detoxiﬁca-

## Page 5

tion strength (e.g., longer ﬁnetuning for DAPT or

higher ω for GeDi) exacerbates these problems.

In our experiments, we test multiple detoxiﬁca-

tion methods to show that this bias is not linked to

a speciﬁc technique, but instead to the process of

detoxiﬁcation in the presence of biased supervised

data. In fact, other controllable generation tech-

niques, including prompts (Wallace et al., 2019;

Sheng et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020) or conditional

LMs (Keskar et al., 2019) will likely exhibit the

same type of biases.

5

Harms of Detoxiﬁcation

Our results demonstrate that the current state of

detoxiﬁcation poses representational harms (Blod-

gett et al., 2020) to minority groups. We discuss

the concrete impacts of these harms below.

In-group Harms

Detoxiﬁed LMs are deployed

in downstream NLP systems in which they di-

rectly engage with end users. In addition to LMs

not being able to generate minority identity men-

tions and minority dialects, our results suggest

that detoxiﬁed LMs also struggle to understand

these aspects of language. This could lead to sce-

narios where end users who are AAE speakers

must code-switch to WAE to ensure that NLP sys-

tems work effectively for them. Aside from be-

ing an annoyance, this is also a microaggression

that poses psychological harms and may discour-

age AAE speakers from engaging with NLP sys-

tems whatsoever.

Stigmatization of Language

Detoxiﬁed models

also have a propensity to avoid certain topics, e.g.,

mentioning a minority identity term. As a practi-

cal example, the (detoxiﬁed) Microsoft Zo chatbot

was capable of discussing Christianity but could

not discuss Islam (Stuart-Ulin, 2018). Failures like

these further two types of stigma. First, having

one’s identity silenced by an NLP system can lead

to self-stigmatization and long-term health conse-

quences. Second, a lack of informed, conscious

discussion on topics of identity or dialect can mag-

nify existing societal stigmas. For example, align-

ing an LM solely with WAE stigmatizes AAE

as incorrect or “bad” English (Flores and Rosa,

2015). In the technology industry, this can perpet-

uate a dangerous expectation that AAE users are

not consumers who matter, stymieing progress on

equitable NLP systems.

Biases Are Not Limited to Detoxiﬁcation

Al-

though we have focused on problems with detox-

iﬁcation in this paper, similar failures will oc-

cur whenever controllable generation methods are

used. For example, a common goal is to control

the sentiment of generated text (Dathathri et al.,

2020; Krause et al., 2020). Unfortunately, since

sentiment datasets are often biased against cer-

tain racial groups (Kiritchenko and Mohammad,

2018), controlling the sentiment of text will also

affect which races are discussed.

6

Future Work: Towards Bias-Free

Detoxiﬁcation

The harms that we have identiﬁed occur largely

due to spurious correlations in toxicity datasets.

A natural direction for future work is to thus im-

prove datasets, for example, by changing the an-

notation procedure (Sap et al., 2019) or labeling

scheme (Kennedy et al., 2020; Sap et al., 2020).

Unfortunately, this can also make collecting an-

notations more expensive. As an alternative or in

addition to higher quality data, there is growing

interest in training accurate models in the pres-

ence of biased data (Oren et al., 2019; Clark et al.,

2019).

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art debiasing

methods are still far from perfect (Zhou et al.,

2021). We plan to explore new methods for de-

biasing both datasets and models in future work.
