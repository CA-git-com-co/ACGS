Abstract

In-context learning (ICL) empowers large

language models (LLMs) to perform diverse

tasks in underrepresented languages using

only short in-context information, offering a

crucial avenue for narrowing the gap between

high-resource and low-resource languages.

Nonetheless, there is only a handful of works

explored ICL for low-resource languages

with most of them focusing on relatively

high-resource languages,

such as French

and Spanish.

In this work, we extensively

study ICL and its cross-lingual variation

(X-ICL) on 25 low-resource and 7 relatively

higher-resource languages.

Our study not

only assesses the effectiveness of ICL with

LLMs in low-resource languages but also

identifies the shortcomings of in-context label

alignment, and introduces a more effective

alternative: query alignment. Moreover, we

provide valuable insights into various facets

of ICL for low-resource languages.

Our

study concludes the significance of few-shot

in-context information on enhancing the

low-resource understanding quality of LLMs

through semantically relevant information by

closing the language gap in the target language

and aligning the semantics between the

targeted low-resource and the high-resource

language that the model is proficient in. Our

work highlights the importance of advancing

ICL research, particularly for low-resource

languages. Our code is publicly released at

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have displayed

remarkable generalization capability in various

tasks (Brown et al., 2020b; Kojima et al., 2022;

Wei et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022; Rae et al.,

2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022;

Liang et al., 2023; Srivastava et al., 2023; Love-

nia et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2023).

Nonethe-

less, these models face difficulties in generaliz-

ing across different languages, leading to perfor-

mance disparity, particularly for low-resource lan-

guages (Aji et al., 2022a; Ebrahimi et al., 2022a;

Adelani et al., 2022b; Cahyawijaya et al., 2023a,b;

Asai et al., 2023). A myriad of research works ad-

dress this problem through language-specific fine-

tuning (Wilie et al., 2020; Kakwani et al., 2020;

Cahyawijaya et al., 2021; Adelani et al., 2021; Ku-

mar et al., 2022) which often leads to catastrophic

forgetting (French, 1993; Chaudhry et al., 2019;

Rolnick et al., 2019). Another line of work utilizes

continual learning and adapter-based methods to

inject new languages to existing LLMs (Yong et al.,

2022; Cahyawijaya et al., 2023c; Jin et al., 2023).

Nevertheless, these methods rely on performing

multiple steps of parameter updates which require

huge computational budgets, particularly for very

large LLMs with hundreds of billion parameters.

To cope with this problem, prior works (Winata

et al., 2021b; Lin et al., 2022a; Shi et al., 2023;

Zhang et al., 2023) explore cross-lingual in-context

learning (X-ICL) methods, an extension from in-

context learning (ICL), that allow LLMs to gen-

erate better response quality in low-resource lan-

guages without the need for parameter tuning. In X-

ICL, source language exemplars are incorporated

into the input context allowing the model to transfer

the task understanding capability from the source,

commonly high-resource, language into the target

language query (Winata et al., 2021b; Shi et al.,

2023). However, X-ICL still fails to compete with

a simple translate-test baseline, prominently for

low-resource languages. A recent work (Tanwar

et al., 2023) further enhances X-ICL through se-

mantically similar cross-lingual exemplars and in-

context label alignment1, yielding a large gain over

the baselines on relatively high-resource languages

1In Tanwar et al. (2023), label alignment is referred to as

task alignment. In this work, we distinguish two types of task

alignments, i.e., query alignment and label alignment (§3.1).

such as French, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese.

In this work, we expand upon the concept of

cross-lingual semantic similarity and in-context

alignment, specifically focusing on low-resource

languages. Our hypothesis posits that their effec-

tiveness may be compromised in low-resource lan-

guages due to the weak representation of the la-

bels and sentences for the target languages. To

test our hypothesis, we explore cross-lingual in-

context learning (X-ICL) covering 25 low-resource

languages from various language families and com-

pare them with the performance of 7 relatively

higher resource languages, including French (fra),

Spanish (spa), German (deu), Italian (ita), Por-

tuguese (por), Arabic (arb), and Hindi (hin). Our

result suggests that the X-ICL performance decays

correlate to the size of pre-training data of the target

languages, which aligns with our hypothesis. More-

over, to our surprise, contrary to the results reported

in (Tanwar et al., 2023), we found that in-context

label alignment does not work for all the languages

under study and introduced an alternative align-

ment method namely in-context query alignment,

which significantly improves the alignment quality

compared to the in-context label alignment.

To this end, we explore alternatives for X-ICL

approaches covering variations of in-context align-

ment information, prompt, label encoding, and

strategy for selecting in-context learning exemplars.

We extensively analyze all these factors and their

effect on the downstream task performance of all

the languages under study. Our results and analysis

highlight the following key takeaways:

• Contrary to prior work (Tanwar et al., 2023),

we found that label alignment undermines the

performance in most languages. Keeping uni-

form labels from the high-resource language

often yields the best results.

• We introduce a new approach for cross-lingual

alignment, i.e., query alignment, which is

more effective than label alignment and can

substitute or complement X-ICL.

• We analyze the effect of improving prompt for-

mat consistency on low-resource languages.

However, despite improving performance

for higher-resource languages, format consis-

tency does not yield any benefit to the low-

resource languages under study.

• We present a comprehensive in-context learn-

ing framework for better low-resource lan-

guage understanding under various con-

strained conditions, concluding the signifi-

cance of few-shot in-context information on

enhancing the low-resource understanding

quality of LLMs through semantically rele-

vant information, where monolingual ICL

does so by closing the language and domain

gap on the targeted downstream task, while

X-ICL closes the domain gap to the target

downstream task, and in-context alignment

closes the semantic gap between the targeted

low-resource and the high-resource language

that the model is proficient in.

2.1

In-Context Learning

The in-context learning paradigm, originally intro-

duced by Brown et al. (2020a), has significantly

advanced our understanding of LLMs’ capabilities.

It demonstrated that LLMs can effectively perform

complex tasks through in-context learning with just

task-specific formatting and a few task-specific ex-

amples (few-shot) or none at all (zero-shot). This

ability is facilitated by the LLMs’ increasing ca-

pacity for generalization across diverse tasks, e.g.,

machine translation, question answering, and do-

main adaptation, without gradient updates.

Another line of work expands the scope of

the study to multilingual generative LLMs, i.e.,

BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), trained on the ROOTS

corpus covering 46 natural and 13 programming

languages, and XGLM (Lin et al., 2022b), trained

on 500B tokens comprising 30 languages, which

exhibit robust zero-shot and few-shot performances

on multilingual NLP tasks. Furthermore, Lin et al.

(2022b) address the imbalance in language repre-

sentation by up-sampling the less-resourced lan-

guages. Bandarkar et al. (2023) then expand the

language coverage of the in-context learning eval-

uation to 122 languages through Belebele, a wide-

scale multilingual multiple-choice machine reading

comprehension benchmark comprising short pas-

sages from FLORES-200 (Goyal et al., 2022).

Cross-Lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL)

Winata et al. (2021b) were among the first to

explore the potential of few-shot X-ICL. Using

4 high-resource languages, this work shows that

pre-trained LMs significantly outperform random

prediction in cross-lingual tasks and produce bet-

ter results compared to smaller fine-tuned base-

lines. Winata et al. (2022a) expand this study to un-

seen languages and find that taking the X-ICL con-

texts from a mixture of random source languages is

surprisingly more effective compared to linguisti-

cally similar and geographically similar languages.

Expanding the investigation to different aspects of

cross-lingual transfers in X-ICL, Lin et al. (2022b)

explores the use of various languages for instruc-

tions and exemplars. They find that incorporating

English instructions notably improves zero-shot

performance across multiple languages.

In a related vein, Tanwar et al. (2023) analyze

the effect of cross-lingual prompt design for X-ICL

across 3 text classification tasks using 44 different

cross-lingual pairs. Their findings emphasize the

limitations of random exemplar selection and pro-

pose the use of semantic-based exemplar retrieval

and label alignment1 for superior X-ICL perfor-

mance. Notably, their findings diverge from our

results (§5.1), which contend that label alignment

does not provide benefits for X-ICL.

2.2

LLMs on Low-Resource Languages

Rigorous evaluations have been proposed to in-

vestigate how LLMs perform on low-resource lan-

guages. According to (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023a),

while multilingual LLMs typically exhibit pos-

itive transfer learning among related languages,

these models perform notably better for mid- and

high-resource (e.g., Indonesian and English) com-

pared to low-resource languages (e.g., other 18

Indonesian indigenous languages). This implies a

challenge in the generalization capability of exist-

ing multilingual LLMs to low-resource languages.

This is further evidenced by (Cahyawijaya et al.,

2023b), which extends the exploration to 12 low-

resource and extremely low-resource languages,

where both existing zero-shot prompting LLMs

and fine-tuned pre-trained LMs struggle to outper-

form classical machine learning baselines, which

is indicative of LLMs’ limited ability to general-

ize to extremely low-resource languages that are

significantly distinct from those encountered dur-

ing their training. Similar observations have been

reported by Asai et al. (2023); Bang et al. (2023);

Adilazuarda et al. (2024) for lower-resource lan-

guages. Furthermore, another line of work empha-

sizes the challenges faced by multilingual LLMs

in understanding (Zhang et al., 2023; Adilazuarda

et al., 2023) and generating (Yong et al., 2023)

code-switching, a real use case and nuance of mul-

tilingualism exhibited by human speakers.

Methods

Figure 1 presents the general framework of X-ICL,

comprising: 1) cross-lingual in-context alignment

(§3.1), 2) cross-lingual alignment formatting and 3)

label configuration as parts of cross-lingual prompt-

ing (§3.2), as well as 4) cross-lingual retrieval

(§3.3). We assess variations of these X-ICL as-

pects to understand their effectiveness on different

language resource levels.

3.1

Cross-Lingual Alignment

Prior works showcase the benefit of cross-lingual

in-context learning with random exemplars which

can improve the zero-shot performance of LLMs

on downstream tasks (Winata et al., 2021c; Shi

et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2023). More recently, Tan-

war et al. (2023) introduce cross-lingual in-context

alignment that injects a label aligner to the prompt

in between the in-context exemplars and the input

query. The label aligner provides the translation of

the source label set Csrc = {csrc

1 , csrc

2 , . . . , csrc

k }

to the target label set Ctgt = {ctgt

1 , ctgt

2 , . . . , ctgt

k }.

For instance, given a target language Ltgt, the label

aligner prompt is formatted as follow: “In Ltgt,

csrc

1

means ctgt

1 , csrc

2

means ctgt

2 ,. . . , and csrc

k

means ctgt

k ”. This allows the model to align labels

between source and target languages. We call this

method in-context label alignment.

As opposed to in-context label alignment, we

and tabular-prompting. From left to right, the prompt format has a higher degree of format consistency.

explore another approach, dubbed in-context

query alignment, which provides alignment of

input distribution by providing the translation

of sentences similar to the query while keep-

ing the label set as is.

To do so, we uti-

lize the parallel exemplar dataset Dpara

=

{(ssrc

1 , stgt

1 ), (ssrc

2 , stgt

2 ), . . . , (ssrc

m , stgt

m )}, where

(ssrc

i

, stgt

i ) respectively denotes to a pair of parallel

source and target sentences, and select the top-k

most similar parallel pair by maximizing the mono-

lingual similarity between the qtgt with stgt

i . Given

a target language Ltgt, the parallel pairs are then

formatted into an input alignment prompt, i.e., “In

Ltgt, ssrc

1

means stgt

1 , ssrc

2

means stgt

2 , . . . ,

and ssrc

k

means stgt

k ”. We show the example query

for in-context label alignment and in-context query

alignment in Appendix B.

3.2

Cross-Lingual Prompting

Although cross-lingual in-context alignment has

shown improvements as reported in (Tanwar et al.,

2023), it introduces distortions to certain aspects

of the Bayesian inference framework (Xie et al.,

2022; Min et al., 2022) underlying in-context learn-

ing. Notably, this method compromises the for-

matting consistency and output distribution of the

prompt. While the label aligner is expected to align

the output distribution between the source and tar-

get labels, it is merely an idealistic assumption,

which might not be the case in real cases. To better

align with the Bayesian inference framework, we

explore two cross-lingual prompt adjustments, i.e.,

alignment formatting and label configuration.

Alignment Formatting

Existing X-ICL with

alignment approach (Tanwar et al., 2023) places

the alignment between ICL exemplars and the in-

put query (dubbed as alignment-after). We ar-

gue that such abrupt changes in the prompt for-

mat might cause performance degradation. To im-

prove the format consistency, we also explore two

prompt formats for X-ICL: 1) alignment-before

and 2) tabular-prompting. Alignment-before sim-

ply swaps the alignment text with the cross-lingual

exemplars. This avoids the abrupt format change

between the exemplars and the query such that the

neighboring text span is more format-consistent.

Tabular-prompting formats the prompt in the form

of a table with multiple columns, which allows a

consistent prompt format, but at the same time re-

quires either a labeled parallel corpus or disrupting

the input-output mapping through incorrect label-

ing (Min et al., 2022). The depiction of the prompt

formats and the X-ICL alignment is in Figure 2.

Label Configuration

To improve the output dis-

tribution consistency, we explore alternatives of

using either source-only labels and target-only

labels as opposed to in-context label alignment

which shifts the language of the labels from the

source language in the exemplars to the target lan-

guage in qtgt. These alternatives serve as a com-

parison to measure the effectiveness of in-context

label alignment. In this study, we focus on English

as the source language. Appendix F analyzes the

use of other closely related source languages.

is by improving the exemplar retrieval qual-

ity.

bel of the exemplar, the goal of cross-lingual re-

trieval is to retrieve one or more labeled exemplars

(esrc

) semantically relevant to qtgt.

Most

prior works in X-ICL (Winata et al., 2021a; Asai

et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022a) in-

corporate random retrieval, while recently, Tanwar

et al. (2023) utilize cross-lingual semantic simi-

larity which significantly improves performance

over the random retrieval.

Nevertheless, we argue that this approach might

not be optimal in the case of low-resource lan-

guages as the semantic representation for these

languages might not be well aligned with the high-

resource languages (see Appendix C). Thus, we

explore translation semantic similarity as an al-

ternative. It performs monolingual semantic sim-

ilarity on qtgt to obtain a sentence in Ltgt from

a parallel dataset Dpara, then uses monolingual

semantic similarity on its pair in Lsrc to find the

high-resource exemplars from Dsrc. Although the

monolingual semantic similarity between two sen-

tences from a low-resource language is also sub-

optimal, this problem can be alleviated by incor-

porating other similarity metrics such as TF-IDF

and bag-of-words. We denote ICL method using

the translation semantic similarity as T-ICL. We

show this analysis in Appendix C along with the

depiction of the cross-lingual retrieval methods.

Retrieval and In-Context Learning Setup

To calculate the cross-lingual and monolingual

with 3-shot ICL exemplars. We run our experi-

ments using two LLMs: XGLM-7.5B (Lin et al.,

2022b) and BLOOM-7B (Scao et al., 2022). To

Languages and Datasets

As shown in Table 1, our study includes 25 low-

resource languages from three different regions,

i.e., Africa, Americas, and South-East Asia, cover-

ing 13 language families. Note that, many of the

low-resource languages are unseen to both XGLM

and BLOOM, nonetheless, both models might have

seen other languages under the same language fam-

ily group with those low-resource languages, e.g.,

both models are pre-trained on Indonesian, which

falls under the same language family group (i.e.,

Malayo-Polynesian) to the low-resource languages

in Indonesia. We also include 7 relatively higher-

resource languages, i.e., Arabic (arb), French (fra),

German (deu), Hindi (hin), Italian (ita), Portuguese

(por), and Spanish (spa) for comparing the behavior

of X-ICL between these relatively higher-resource

languages and low-resource languages. Detailed

information on all the languages under study is

shown in Appendix A.

All the languages are spread across four differ-

ent datasets, i.e., MasakhaNews (topic classifica-

tion) (Adelani et al., 2023), AmericasNLI (natural

language inference) (Ebrahimi et al., 2022b),

NusaTranslation (sentiment analysis) (Cahyaw-

ijaya et al., 2023b), and TweetSentimentMultilin-

gual (sentiment analysis) (Barbieri et al., 2022).

For each dataset, we defined the ICL dataset Dsrc

and parallel alignment dataset Dpara from differ-

ent dataset subsets or completely different datasets.

performance. For low-resource African languages,

the target-only label performs much worse. We

conjecture that this is due to the weak representa-

tion of these languages, which is less apparent in

low-resource Indonesian and American languages

because the target labels (see Appendix D) are sim-

ilar to higher-resource languages in training. Con-

trary to Tanwar et al. (2023), our results highlight

the ineffectiveness of in-context label alignment

to improve X-ICL on both higher-resource and low-

resource languages.

5.2

In-Context Query Alignment

We introduce in-context query alignment as an al-

ternative to in-context label alignment in §3.1. As

shown in Figure 4, in-context query alignment

yields similar performance with the baseline (i.e.,

without query alignment) on higher-resource lan-

guages while improving zero-shot performance on

low-resource languages. Nonetheless, the improve-

ment is rather marginal in the X-ICL setting on

low-resource languages. In this case, we conclude

that in-context query alignment can be used as an

alternative to X-ICL, which is favorable when there

is no available X-ICL corpus for the particular task.

the understanding of all the languages under study,

we analyze their effectiveness by comparing them

with the corresponding non-alignment baseline.

As shown in Figure 5, in-context label alignment

only improves the performance at ∼11.54% of the

time with an improvement of ∼5% weighted F1,

while the rest 88.46% experiments are decreased

by ∼20% weighted F1. In-context query align-

ment, on the other hand, increases the performance

56.25% of the time with an improvement of ∼10%

weighted F1, while the rest 43.75% of the time ex-

periences a reduction of ∼5% weighted F1. Our

results suggest that in-context query alignment

is superior to in-context label alignment, and it

improves LLMs’ understanding of low-resource

languages in the absence of X-ICL task-specific

data, which leads to performance gain.

5.3

Why Query Alignment Performs Better

In regards to the in-context alignment, we can first

simplify the effect of alignment into the following

two possibilities: 1) when the alignment is suc-

cessful (upper bound) and when no alignment is

done (lower bound). When The LLM successfully

aligns the query in the source language to the target

language, query alignment will enable the LLM

to understand the query in the target as well as in

the source languages, the LLM will reach a perfor-

mance similar to monolingual ICL, which is the up-

per bound performance. While in label alignment,

when the LLM successfully aligns the label in the

source to the target languages, the LLM under-

stands the label semantics, but there is no guidance

on how to interpret the query in the target language.

In this case, the upper bound is equivalent to per-

forming X-ICL which generally performs slightly

worse than monolingual high-resource language

ICL which is reflected in our result in §5.6.

When the LLM completely fails to align the la-

bel in the source to the target languages, in the

query alignment, the LLM performs a regular X-

ICL, which is similar to the best case of the label

alignment. While in the label alignment, the LLM

performs X-ICL with a shifted label space. The

harmful effect of ICL with a shifted label space

has been extensively studied in (Min et al., 2022),

which results in severe performance degradation.

With regards to the two possibilities, the upper-

bound and lower-bound of in-context query align-

ment are better than label alignment, thus query

alignment outperforms label alignment on average.

In a more realistic scenario, there is also another

factor where the alignment text becomes the noise

that will shift the output prediction of the LLMs.

As the noise factor happens for both query and la-

bel alignment, we can assume the same effect of

noise for both methods and omit this factor into

account, resulting in the same conclusion.

5.4

Effect of Format Consistency

We explore three types of prompting with various

degrees of formatting consistency (§3.2). As shown

in Figure 6, for higher-resource languages, format-

ting consistency correlates to a slight improvement

in the downstream performance for both XGLM

and BLOOM (see Appendix G) models. Mean-

while, for low-resource languages, the trend for

both models is unclear. We conjecture that in-

creasing the format consistency can improve the

downstream task performance on well-represented

languages. For low-resource languages, increas-

ing the format consistency will not improve the

model understanding. Increasing the representa-

tion through X-ICL and query alignment would

be a better alternative to improve the low-resource

language understanding ability of LLMs.

5.5

Importance of Cross-Lingual Retrieval

Cross-Lingual Semantic Similarity

We com-

pare the effectiveness of cross-lingual semantic

similarity to monolingual and translation seman-

tic similarity for retrieving ICL and X-ICL exem-

plars. Based on Figure 7, X-ICL and ICL with

cross-lingual and monolingual semantic-similarity-

based retrieval, respectively, perform better than

zero-shot prompting, suggesting the effectiveness

of these approaches for improving the task under-

standing of LLMs. In addition, we show that trans-

lation semantic similarity performs almost on par

with the zero-shot baseline. We hypothesize that

this problem is attributed to the error propagation of

the pipelined nature of the translation semantic sim-

ilarity system and the limited coverage of parallel

exemplars in Dpara, showing the benefit of using

direct cross-lingual semantic similarity retrieval

over translation-based retrieval. Furthermore, the

performance of cross-lingual semantic similarity is

similar to or slightly lower than the monolingual

semantic similarity approach. Hence, cross-lingual

semantic similarity retrieval is important in the case

where the corpus for performing monolingual ICL

on a particular task is not available.

Variations of Semantic Similarity Models

We

further compare the effectiveness of varying the

cross-lingual semantic similarity models for cross-

lingual retrieval.

As shown in Figure 8, all

cross-lingual semantic similarity models outper-

form the zero-shot baseline. Interestingly, despite

the reported inferiority of STS-tuned models over

paraphrasing-tuned models and LaBSE in prior

works (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019, 2020; Feng

et al., 2022), our results showcase otherwise. On av-

erage, XLMR STS performs on par with other mod-

els, gaining a better performance on high-resource

languages while getting a worse performance on

low-resource languages. We find that, depending

on the language under study, the choice of cross-

lingual semantic similarity models can play a huge

role in the downstream performance of X-ICL.

5.6

Is X-ICL Effective for low-resource

Languages?

To analyze the effectiveness of X-ICL in low-

resource languages, we compare X-ICL with other

inference approaches. Specifically, we compare

X-ICL with 3 other baselines: 1) monolingual

ICL that performs inference using ICL from the

same language as the query, 2) translate-test that

translates the query and performs zero-shot infer-

ence in a high-resource language, i.e., English,

and 3) translate-test ICL that simply combines

translate-test and monolingual ICL. We mea-

sure the ∆Weighted F1 against a simple zero-shot

prompting over all languages under study. For all

experiments that include translation, we utilize MT

models from NLLB (Team et al., 2022).3

Based on our experiment results shown in Fig-

ure 9, the translate-test slightly improves the per-

formance from the zero-shot baseline in BLOOM

and XGLM, while in-context query alignment

only improves zero-shot performance on XGLM.

This indicates that alignment information only of-

fers a limited benefit to improving LLMs’ under-

standing. Additionally, all ICL approaches improve

the performance over zero-shot prompting in most

cases. All approaches with similarity-based re-

trieval, i.e., ICL Semantic and X-ICL Semantic

achieve higher scores than random retrievals, i.e.,

ICL Random and X-ICL Random, showing the

importance of semantic similarity for exemplar re-

trievals. Interestingly, X-ICL Semantic yields a

similar performance to ICL Semantic, which uti-

lizes the target language exemplars. This indicates

X-ICL can be a good alternative for low-resource

languages as the available data in the specified

low-resource language are commonly very limited.

Above all, translate-test ICL yields the highest im-

provement amongst all methods, but this only hap-

pens when the machine translation quality is above

a certain quality standard. We ablate the effect of

machine translation quality to the translate-test

ICL performance on Appendix E.

To conclude, we offer the following suggestions

to improve the low-resource language performance

during inference: 1) When tackling low-resource

languages, it is best to have a high-quality trans-

lation system accompanied by a source language

task-specific data for translate-test ICL; 2) When

there is no machine translation (MT) system for

the specified language, it is best to use either ICL

or X-ICL depending on the corpus availability; 3)

When there is an MT system, but no task-specific

data, translate-test is still the best option; and 4)

When there is no high-quality MT system nor task-

specific data, the best way is to use a parallel data

to utilize in-context query-alignment.

Conclusion

We systematically investigate the application of

X-ICL with LLMs, focusing on low-resource lan-

guages. Our comprehensive analysis sheds light on

multiple facets of X-ICL with LLMs. Our examina-

tion of in-context alignment reveals the limitation

of label alignment, thus we suggest a more effective

alternative: query alignment. Efforts to enhance

X-ICL via formatting consistency only exhibit a

marginal impact on low-resource languages. Our

exploration of exemplar retrieval approaches under-

scores the significance of employing cross-lingual

semantic similarity in X-ICL. Lastly, we analyze

the effectiveness of X-ICL in the context of low-

resource languages. Despite being outperformed

by translate-test ICL, X-ICL remains relevant, es-

pecially when there is no MT model available for

the target language—a circumstance prevalent in

low-resource language scenarios.

Ethics Statement

Our exploration of ICL and X-ICL methods ad-

dresses the linguistic data gap in low-resource lan-

guages. In scenarios where no monolingual corpus

or machine translation system exists, our work un-

derscores the significance of ICL and X-ICL as a

viable solution. By investigating the limitations of

in-context label alignment and proposing a more

effective in-context query alignment approach, we

aim to enhance the applicability of ICL and X-

ICL on low-resource languages. This research is

motivated by the need to provide computational

solutions for languages lacking adequate linguistic

resources for LM training. Our findings emphasize

that ICL and X-ICL are useful in scenarios where

alternative resources are absent, promoting linguis-

tic diversity and inclusivity in the development of

language technologies. All the datasets used in our

experiments follow the license and term of use of

the datasets.

Limitation

Limited Coverage of low-resource Languages

We put our best effort into collecting datasets from

various low-resource languages and, in the end, we

ended up with the three low-resource datasets, i.e,

MasakhaNews (Adelani et al., 2023), NusaTrans-

lation (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023b), and Americas-

NLI (Ebrahimi et al., 2022a), which suits our cases

as these languages have parallel datasets which cor-

respond to one or more high-resource languages

and have large enough high-quality labeled datasets

for both ICL and evaluation purposes. Further-

more, our study covers broad enough linguistics

aspects of multilingual and cross-lingual within

these three datasets, including various linguistics

distances with the source languages — from Nige-

rian Pidgin (pcm) to obscure regional languages

such as Batak (btw), Hausa (hau), and Guarani

(grn) —, broad linguistic and geographic diversity

—the low-resource languages under study covers

>10 language families from three different conti-

nents —, and the incorporation of different scripts

between source and target languages — in the case

of Amharic as a low-resource language and Arabic

as a higher-resource language —. We leave the

study of other and broader scales of low-resource

languages for future work.

Choice of Multilingual High-Resource Lan-

guage Datasets

Prior work on X-ICL with

alignment (Tanwar et al., 2023) conduct their

study on Multilingual Amazon Review Corpus

(MARC) (Keung et al., 2020), Cross-language Sen-

timent (CLS) (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010), and

HatEval (Basile et al., 2019). We considered us-

ing these datasets as our high-resource languages

dataset. Nonetheless, we found that both MARC

and CLS datasets are no longer available 4, leav-

ing us with only HatEval dataset. Since HatEval

only covers English and Spanish, we do not in-

corporate it in our study. Instead, we incorporate

the TweetSentimentMultilingual dataset (Barbieri

et al., 2022) which covers 7 relatively high-resource

languages in our study. We leave the exploration

of other high-resource languages to future work.

Task Coverage

Given the nature of low-resource

languages, there are only a handful of datasets avail-

able as downstream tasks. We suggest future works

to explore the generalization of our approach to a

broader task coverage, especially on datasets that

cover more culturally relevant nuances of the corre-

sponding low-resource language (Aji et al., 2022b;

Kabra et al., 2023; Lovenia et al., 2024).

Exploration on Other LLMs

We conduct our

experiments with a single RTX3090 (24GB) GPU.

Due to the large cost of inference and limited com-

putation budget, we do not experiment on larger

multilingual LLMs such as Falcon (Almazrouei

et al., 2023) and MPT (Team, 2023). Nonetheless,

exploration on incorporating ICL and X-ICL with

random exemplar retrieval with larger LLMs and

the scaling effect on low-resource settings, such as

low-resource languages and code-switching, have

been discussed in prior works (Zhang et al., 2023;

Asai et al., 2023; Cahyawijaya et al., 2024). We

hypothesize that the scaling behavior of our work

will follow the same trend.

Correlation of monolingual similarity with the correct label for the XLMR STS model.

We showcase that the semantic representation for these languages might not be well aligned with the

high-resource languages. We construct sentence similarity dataset covering 26 languages by utilizing

the translation samples from two machine translation datasets, i.e., MAFAND (Adelani et al., 2022a)

and NusaX-MT (Winata et al., 2022b). We create a balanced dataset with 50% positive pairs and 50%

negative pairs over all 26 languages. We measure the cross-lingual semantic similarity performance of

using Sentence Transformers (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). We also conduct monolingual semantic

similarity analysis for various languages using the data from SemEval 2024 Task 12: Textual Semantic

Relatedness dataset 5. For the monolingual semantic similarity we add additional word frequency features

including bag-of-words and TF-IDF to improve the retrieval quality of the semantic similarity model.

As shown in Figure 11, both monolingual and cross-lingual semantic similarity on more low-resource

languages are generally yield a much lower correlation which signifies the limitation of the sentence

5https://github.com/semantic-textual-relatedness/Semantic_Relatedness_SemEval2024

## Page 20

embedding model to represent the sentences on these languages. Nevertheless, for monolingual semantic

similarity, it is possible to improve the similarity on these low-resource languages with minimal trade

off on the other language by employing character/word frequency features to support the semantic

similarity model. With that in mind, we explore an alternative approach for cross-lingual retrieval by

using monolingual semantic similarity and an external parallel corpus. We called this semantic similarity

method as translation semantic similarity. The comparison of cross-lingual retrieval using cross-lingual

semantic similarity and translation semantic similarity is shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12: We explore two semantic similarity methods for cross-lingual exemplar retrieval in X-ICL, i.e., cross-

lingual semantic similarity and translation semantic similarity (T-ICL).

Table 8: Performance of NLLB 1.3B model on FLORES-200 with the machine-translated zero-shot and few-shot

ICL performance of XGLM and BLOOMZ using the corresponding NLLB translation.

We showcase that the MT model performance plays a huge role in determining the language understand-

ing quality through machine translation (MT). We showcase the MT model performance on the devtest

subset of FLORES-200 (Goyal et al., 2022) along with the zero-shot with MT and few-shot ICL with

MT performance in Table 8. The zero-shot (MT) performance has a low-to-moderate correlation with the

machine translation quality (chrF++) of the model (0.416 for XGLM and 0.247 for BLOOMZ), while

the few-shot ICL (MT) has a lower correlation (0.102 for XGLM and 0.238 for BLOOMZ) potentially

due to the effect of other factors such as the semantic similarity exemplar selection and the quality of

the ICL data itself. Our result indicates that, despite being effective for language understanding, the

MT-based zero-shot and few-shot inference approach depends on the quality of the machine translation

models. Moreover, an MT-based solution might not work as well for cultural-specific tasks which have

been addressed in various works (Kabra et al., 2023; Koto et al., 2023; Wibowo et al., 2023).

Effects of Source Languages

We explore alternative source languages for NusaTranslation (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023b). For NusaTrans-

lation we utilize Indonesian as the source language because Indonesian is the closely related to the

languages under study on the corresponding dataset and is widely spoken languages in the respective

region. We modify both the prompt language and the source ICL dataset Dsrc.

The result is shown in Figure 13. We can clearly see that in most cases, using English as the source

language tends to produce better score than these closely related languages. Similar observation is also

reported in prior works (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023a; Asai et al., 2023) which evaluates the prompt using

different prompt language. Our experiment further extend the generalization to the X-ICL setting, where

X-ICL using English exemplars outperforms X-ICL with a more closely related languages exemplars.
