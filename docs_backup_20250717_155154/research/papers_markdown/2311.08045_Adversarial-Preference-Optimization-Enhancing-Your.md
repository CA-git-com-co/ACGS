Abstract

Human preference alignment is essential to

improve the interaction quality of large lan-

guage models (LLMs).

Existing alignment

methods depend on manually annotated pref-

erence data to guide the LLM optimization

directions. However, continuously updating

LLMs for alignment raises a distribution gap

between model-generated samples and human-

annotated responses, hindering training effec-

tiveness. To mitigate this issue, previous meth-

ods require additional preference annotation on

newly generated samples to adapt to the shifted

distribution, which consumes a large amount

of annotation resources. Targeting more effi-

cient human preference optimization, we pro-

pose an Adversarial Preference Optimization

(APO) framework, in which the LLM and the

reward model update alternatively via a min-

max game. Through adversarial training, the

reward model can adapt to the shifted gen-

eration distribution of the LLM without any

additional annotation.

With comprehensive

experiments, we find the proposed adversar-

ial training framework further enhances ex-

isting alignment baselines in terms of LLM

helpfulness and harmlessness. The code is at

Introduction

Learned from massive textual data with billions

of parameters, large language models (LLMs),

such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Gemini (Team

et al., 2023), have shown remarkable AI capabil-

ities, especially in domains of natural language

processing (Jiao et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023),

logical reasoning (Liu et al., 2023a; Frieder et al.,

2023), and programming (Surameery and Shakor,

2023; Tian et al., 2023). Among the training tech-

niques that help LLMs achieve such success, hu-

man preference alignment finetunes LLMs to fol-

low users’ feedback, which has been widely rec-

*Equal Contribution.

ognized as essential for improving human-model

interaction (Ouyang et al., 2022). However, highly

qualified human feedback requires meticulous an-

notations of query-response pairs in various top-

ics (Askell et al., 2021), which is rather challeng-

ing and forms a sharp contrast to the easy access

of enormous unsupervised pretraining text corpus.

Hence, the limitation of preference data collection

raises demands for training sample efficiency of

preference alignment methods (Yuan et al., 2023;

Sun et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023).

To utilize preference data, current feedback

alignment methods are proposed mainly from three

perspectives (Wang et al., 2023b): reinforcement

learning (Ouyang et al., 2022), contrastive learn-

ing (Yuan et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023;

Liu et al., 2023c), and language modeling (Dong

et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b; Wang et al.,

2023a). Reinforcement learning with human feed-

back (RLHF)

(Kreutzer et al., 2018; Ziegler

et al., 2019) is the earliest exploration and has

been acknowledged as the mainstream for LLM

alignment (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al.,

2023b). RLHF first learns a reward model from

the human preference data, then optimizes the ex-

pected reward score of the LLM’s output samples

via the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algo-

rithm (Schulman et al., 2017). Although widely

used, RLHF has been criticized as being unstable

during the fine-tuning and complicated in imple-

mentation and computational resource consump-

tion (Yuan et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023).

Towards more efficient and stable training, in-

stead of directly optimizing the non-differentiable

rewards, contrastive learning methods enlarge the

likelihood gap between preferred and rejected re-

sponse pairs (Yuan et al., 2023; Rafailov et al.,

2023; Zhao et al., 2023). Alternatively, language

modeling-based methods remain using language

modeling loss to align preference, but with different

data preparation strategies (Dong et al., 2023; Liu

arXiv:2311.08045v4  [cs.CL]  3 Jun 2024

## Page 2

et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023a). For example, re-

jection sampling (Dong et al., 2023; Touvron et al.,

2023b) select responses with top reward scores as

the language modeling fine-tuning samples, while

Wang et al. (2023a) and Liu et al. (2023b) add dif-

ferent prompts to different responses based on the

corresponding preference levels.

Although contrastive-learning and language-

modeling-based methods have partially alleviated

the inefficiency of RLHF, the sampling distribu-

tion shifting problem (Touvron et al., 2023b) still

hinders the alignment effectiveness: after a few

steps of RLHF updates, a distribution gap emerges

between LLM generated samples and preference-

annotated data (as in Figure 1). Consequently, the

reward model learned with human annotation loses

its performance in providing faithful reward signals

on newly generated responses, which damages the

alignment performance. To address this problem,

most aforementioned alignment methods require

additional annotation of human feedback on newly

generated responses after a certain amount of LLM

updating steps (Touvron et al., 2023b), which leads

to increasingly massive manpower costs (Askell

et al., 2021). Besides, the vast time consumption

of extra manual annotation also significantly slows

down the alignment training process.

To reduce the manual annotation efforts and

improve the preference optimization efficiency,

we propose a novel adversarial learning frame-

work called Adversarial Preference Optimization

## (Apo).

Inspired by generative adversarial net-

works (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Arjovsky

et al., 2017), we conduct an adversarial game

between the reward model (RM) and the LLM:

the LLM generates responses to maximize the ex-

pected reward score, while the RM aims to dis-

tinguish the score difference between golden and

sampled responses. To verify the effectiveness of

the APO framework, we conduct experiments on

the Helpful&Harmless (Bai et al., 2022) datasets

with Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) and LLaMA-2 (Tou-

vron et al., 2023b) as the base models. With the

same amount of human preference data, both the

LLM and RM receive additional performance gains

through the APO game, compared with several

commonly used LLM alignment baselines.

Preliminary

Human Preference Alignment

aims to fine-tune

the LLM response policy πθ(y|x) with a group

of human preference data DP = {(x, yw, yl)},

Figure 1: Sampling distribution shifting: after LLM

updating, the response sample distribution shifts (from

the blue curve to the green curve), raising a gap with the

preference annotation range.

so that the LLM can generate more satisfying

responses to improve the human-model interac-

tion quality. In each preference triplet (x, yw, yl),

yw ≻yl means response yw is more “preferred”

than yl with respect to input x. To align the LLM,

a reward model (RM) (Christiano et al., 2017;

Ouyang et al., 2022) rϕ(x, y) is commonly utilized

to score the quality of the LLM generated samples.

RM learns human preferences DP with a ranking

loss (Bradley and Terry, 1952) Lrank(rϕ; DP) :=

−EDP[log σ(rϕ(x, yw) −rϕ(x, yl))],

(1)

where σ(·) is the Sigmoid function. For a response

pair (y, ˜y), the reward difference rϕ(x, y) −

rϕ(x, ˜y) provides a preference probability :

Qϕ(y ≻˜y|x) =

exp(rϕ(x, y))

exp(rϕ(x, y)) + exp(rϕ(x, ˜y))

=σ(rϕ(x, y) −rϕ(x, ˜y)).

(2)

With equation 2, training RM with the Bradley-

Terry ranking loss can be explained as the log-

likelihood maximization of Qϕ:

Lrank(rϕ; DP) = −EDP[log Qϕ(yw ≻yl|x)] (3)

With a learned RM rϕ(x, y), human preference

alignment methods (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov

et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023c) target on maximizing

the reward expectation of generated responses:

max

πθ Ex∼D,y∼πθ(y|x)[rϕ(x, y)]

−βKL[πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x)],

(4)

where πref(y|x) is a reference language model.

KL[πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x)] prevents πθ(y|x) from the

degeneration of repeating a single response with the

highest reward score, which also preserves the gen-

eration diversity. Since response samples y are dis-

crete, it is challenging to directly back-propagate

from reward rϕ(x, y) to policy πθ(y|x). The typ-

ical solution to equation 4 is reinforcement learn-

ing from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al.,

## Page 3

2022), via the proximal policy optimization (PPO)

algorithms (Schulman et al., 2017).

However, PPO suffers from implementation

complexity and training instability (Yuan et al.,

2023; Sun et al., 2023). Recent studies try to avoid

online reinforcement learning with offline schemes.

DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) finds a connection be-

tween the reward model and LLM’s optimal so-

lution, then replaces the reward model with the

likelihood ratio of πθ and πref, as LDPO(πθ) :=

## −E



log σ

 β log πθ(yw|x)

πref(yw|x) −β log πθ(yl|x)

πref(yl|x)



.

Analogously, other methods consider human feed-

back learning from the perspective of contrastive

learning. For example, RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023)

propose a ranking loss as LRRHF(πθ) :=

## −Ed



ReLU(log πθ(yl|x)−log πθ(yw|x))

−λ logπθ(ybest|x)



(5)

where ybest is the corresponding response to x with

the highest reward, and the preference data D can

be built from human annotation DP or RM ranking

results. Besides, rejection sampling (RJS) (Tou-

vron et al., 2023b) (also called RAFT (Dong et al.,

2023) and best-of-N (Stiennon et al., 2020)) di-

rectly fine-tunes LLM on ybest to further simplify

the alignment process, LRJS(πθ) :=

−Ex∼D,y1,y2,...yS∼πθ(y|x)[log πθ(ybest|x)]

(6)

where ybest = arg max1≤s≤S{rϕ(x, ys)} is the

sampled response with the highest reward score.

Azar et al. (2023) extend the alignment objective

into a more general form by replacing RM rϕ with

the human preference probability P(y ≻˜y|x):

max

πθ Ex∼D,y∼πθ(·|x),˜y∼µ(·|x)[Ψ(P(y ≻˜y|x))]

−βKL[πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x)],

(7)

where Ψ(·) is a non-decreasing real-value function.

This general alignment objective is called ΨPO.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

are

a classical group of unsupervised machine learning

approaches that can fit complicated real-data distri-

butions in an adversarial learning scheme (Goodfel-

low et al., 2014). GANs use a discriminator D(·)

and a generator G(·) to play a min-max game. The

generator tries to cheat the discriminator with real-

looking generated samples, while the discriminator

aims to distinguish the true data and the samples:

min

G max

D V (D,G) = Ex∼Pdata(x)[log D(x)]

(8)

+ Ez∼Pz(z)[log(1 −D(G(z))],

where z is a random vector from prior Pz(z) to

induce the generation sample distribution. The

objective equation 8 has been theoretically justified

as the Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence between

distributions of real data and samples (Goodfellow

et al., 2014). Arjovsky et al. (2017) replace the JS

divergence with the Wasserstein distance (Villani,

2009) and propose the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN):

min

gθ

max

∥f∥L≤K EPdata[f(x)] −EPz[f(gθ(z))],

(9)

where ∥f∥L ≤K requires f(·) to be a K-Lipschitz

continuous function. Wasserstein GANs have been

recognized with higher training stability than the

original GANs (Arjovsky et al., 2017).

In policy optimization of reinforcement learning,

inspired by GANs, Ho and Ermon (2016) propose

generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL):

min

πθ max

## D

Eπθ(a|s)[log(D(s, a))]

(10)

+ EπE(a|s)[log(1 −D(s, a))] −λH(πθ),

where a is the corresponding action based on the

state s, D is a discriminator distinguishing differ-

ence between the learning policy πθ and an expert

policy πE, and H(πθ) is the entropy of πθ.

In natural language generation, GANs have

also been empirically explored (Zhang et al.,

2016, 2017), where a text generator samples real-

looking text and a discriminator makes judgment

between the ground-truth text and generated sam-

ples. TextGAIL (Wu et al., 2021) applies GAIL

(equation 10) into text generation, which optimizes

the language model as a response policy πθ(y|x),

by reducing the distribution divergence between

model-generated samples and human responses.

Adversarial Preference Optimization

We begin with a revisit of the human preference

alignment in a mathematical optimization form:

max

πθ

Ex∼D,y∼πθ(y|x)[rϕ(x, y)],

(11)

s.t. KL[πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x)] < η,

which maximizes the expected reward value un-

der the generation policy πθ(y|x), under a KL-

constraint with the reference πref(y|x). Applying

the method of Lagrange multipliers, one can easily

## Page 4

obtain the original alignment objective in equa-

tion 4. As discussed in Section 1, the above opti-

mization becomes ineffective after several steps of

LLM updating, because of the sample distribution

shifting problem in Figure 1. To address this prob-

lem, we aim to adapt the RM correspondingly with

the LLM updates. Inspired by GANs (Goodfellow

et al., 2014), we design the following adversarial

game between the LLM πθ and RM rϕ:

min

rϕ max

πθ

EPθ(x,y)[rϕ(x, y)] −EPgold(x,y)[rϕ(x, y)]

s.t. KL[P(y ≻˜y|x)∥Qϕ(y ≻˜y|x)] < η2,

KL[πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x)] < η1,

(12)

where Pθ(x, y) = πθ(y|x)PD(x) is the model-

generated sample distribution, and Pgold(x, y) de-

notes the annotated golden response distribution.

Based on equation 12, we conduct an adversarial

game, in which LLM πθ(y|x) needs to improve its

response quality to get a higher expected reward,

while RM rϕ(x, y) tries to enlarge the reward gap

between the golden responses and the generation

from πθ(y|x). Inspired by the original preference

alignment objective (equation 11), we add two KL

regularizers to πθ and rϕ respectively to prevent

over-fitting and degeneration. Here P(y ≻˜y|x)

denotes the ground-truth human preference prob-

ability, and Qϕ(y ≻˜y|x) is described in equa-

tion 2. Note that we use the reverse KL[πθ∥πref] to

constrain the generative model πθ but the forward

KL[P∥Qϕ] for the discriminate model rϕ. Our in-

tuition is that KL[πθ∥πref] can be estimated with

πθ-generated samples, paying more attention to

the generation quality; while KL[P∥Qϕ] is practi-

cally estimated with groud-truth preference data,

focusing on the preference fitting ability of reward

models. We call this novel optimization form as

Adversarial Preference Optimization (APO).

To play the adversarial game above, we alter-

natively update one epoch of πθ(y|x) or rϕ(x, y)

with the other’s parameters fixed. Next, we provide

detailed descriptions of the RM optimization step

and LLM optimization step of APO separately.

3.1

RM Optimization Step

For RM optimization of APO, we fix LLM πθ(y|x)

and update rϕ(x, y). Note that in equation 12

KL[πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x)] has no relation with rϕ, so

we can simplify the objective for RM updates:

min

rϕ EPθ(x,y)[rϕ(x, y)] −EPgold(x,y)[rϕ(x, y)]

s.t. KL[P(y ≻˜y|x)∥Qϕ(y ≻˜y|x)] < η2 (13)

The equation 13 indicates that the APO-RM should

enlarge the reward gap between golden answers

and generated responses to challenge πθ(y|x) for

better generation quality. Note that equation 13 has

a similar form as WGANs in equation 9, which

can be intuitively explained as the calculation of

the Wasserstein distance between distributions Pθ

and Pgold. However, equation 13 is not rigorously

a Wasserstein distance because rϕ(x, y) does not

satisfy the Lipschitz continuity as described in Ar-

jovsky et al. (2017).

To practically implement APO-RM training,

we first collect a set of user queries {xm} ∼

PD(x), then annotate each xm with a golden re-

sponse ygold

m , Dgold = {(xm, ygold

m )}M

m=1. Each

(xm, ygold) can be regarded as a sample drawn

from Pgold(x, y). Meanwhile, we generate ys

m ∼

πθ(y|xm), so that (xm, ys

m) is a sample from

distribution Pθ(x, y) = PD(x)πθ(y|x). Denote

Dsample = {(xm, ys

m)}M

m=1.

Combining ygold

and ys, we obtain an APO sample set DAPO =

{(xm, ygold

m , ys

m)}. Then the APO-RM objective

in equation 13 can be calculated:

min

rϕ EPθ(x,y)[rϕ(x, y)] −EPgold(x,y)[rϕ(x, y)]

= min

rϕ EDsample[rϕ(x, ys)] −EDgold[rϕ(x, ygold)]

= max

rϕ EDAPO[rϕ(x, ygold) −rϕ(x, ys)].

(14)

Note that equation 14 also enlarges the reward dif-

ference between pairs of responses as the Bradley-

Terry (BT) loss (equation 1) does. Hence, for train-

ing stability, we empirically use the BT loss to

optimize equation 14 instead, Lrank(rϕ; DAPO) :=

## −Edapo



log σ

 rϕ(x, ygold) −rϕ(x, ys)



(15)

With a Lagrange multiplier β2 > 0, we convert the

KL constraint in equation 13 to a regularizer:

LAPO-RM(rϕ) = Lrank(rϕ; DAPO)

(16)

+ β2KL[P(y ≻˜y|x)∥Qϕ(y ≻˜y|x)].

Note that KL[P∥Qϕ] = EP [log P −log Qϕ] =

−H(P) −EP [log Qϕ], where H(P) is the entropy

of ground-truth human preference P(y ≻˜y|x) as

a constant for rϕ updating. As introduced in equa-

tion 2, with a preference set DP = {(xn, yw

n , yl

n)}

representing samples of P(y ≻˜y|x), we have

−EP [log Qϕ] = Lrank(rϕ; DP). Then, the overall

loss LAPO-RM(rϕ) is equivalent to:

Lrank(rϕ; DAPO) + β2Lrank(rϕ; DP).

(17)

## Page 5

Figure 2: The APO framework. In the RM updating step, the RM learns by distinguishing the difference between

the manually annotated golden responses and the LLM-generated samples. In the LLM updating step, the LLM

updates to generate higher-quality responses with the feedback from the RM.

The above APO-RM loss involves two datasets

DAPO and DP. Since the golden responses consume

much larger annotation resources than pair-wised

response comparison, DAPO practically has a sig-

nificantly smaller size than DP. In experiments, we

find the re-weighting parameter β requires to be

larger to avoid over-fitting on the relatively smaller

APO sample set DAPO. We conduct more detailed

ablation studies in the experimental Section 4.

3.2

LLM Optimization Step

In the APO-LLM optimization step, we fix

rϕ(x, y) and update policy πθ(y|x), which is

equivalent to the original preference optimization

in equation 4. Naturally, previous preference align-

ing methods, such as PPO (Ouyang et al., 2022),

DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), RRHF (Yuan et al.,

2023), and RJS/RAFT (Dong et al., 2023; Liu et al.,

2023c) remain qualified to solve the optimization

and compatible with the APO framework.

Relation with WGAN

If we treat rϕ(x, y) as

the score function f in equation 9, then the APO

objective has a similar form as the Wasserstein dis-

tance between generation Pθ(x, y) and annotation

Pgold(x, y). However, WGAN only has a Lipschitz

constraint for the score function f (or rϕ), but APO

objective has both KL constraints on both score rϕ

and generation policy πθ.

Relation with GAIL

GAIL is also an adversarial

game designed for policy optimization. The expert

policy πE in GAIL plays a similar role as the golden

distribution Pgold in APO. However, GAIL does not

explicitly have a constraint on the discriminator D,

while APO requires RM rϕ to maintain close to the

ground-truth human preference distribution.

Relation with ΨPO

If we choose the comparison

policy µ(·|x) as the golden annotation, and Ψ(·) =

log(·), the ΨPO objective:

Ex∼D,y∼πθ(·|x),˜y∼µ(·|x)[Ψ(P(y ≻˜y|x))]

=Ex∼D,ys∼πθ,ygold∼Pgold[log P(ys ≻ygold)]

≈EDAPO[log σ(rϕ(x, ys) −rϕ(x, ygold))], (18)

which is exact Lrank(rϕ; DAPO) in equation 15.

Therefore, the APO RM objective is a special case

of ΨPO. However, ΨPO has neither APO’s KL reg-

ularizer to avoid RM overfitting nor the adversarial

learning scheme between rϕ and πθ.

4

Experiments

We verify the effectiveness of APO on the Help-

ful&Harmless (HH) dataset (Bai et al., 2022) with

Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) and LLaMA-2 (Touvron

et al., 2023b) as the base LLM. Due to the limita-

tion of computational resources, we find the origi-

nal PPO (Ouyang et al., 2022) has very low training

efficiency, especially during the online sampling

process. Since recent offline alignment methods

have shown competitive performance to PPO (Yuan

et al., 2023), we choose RJS (Dong et al., 2023),

RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023), and DPO (Rafailov et al.,

2023) as baselines instead.

4.1

Experimental Setups

Data Preparation

In the HH set (Bai et al.,

2022), each query is answered with two responses.

Annotators are asked to label “chosen” or “reject”

for each response based on the interaction quality.

To use HH data for APO experiments, we split the

HH set into three parts as in Table 1:

• Training Data: For separately updating the RM

and LLM, we randomly split HH into an RM

training set (HHRM, 20K queries) and an LLM

training set (HHLLM, 66K queries). In the LLM

training set, we only use the instruction queries

as prompts for LLMs to sample responses and to

update via preference alignment.

• Annotated Golden Data: Due to the annotation

resource limitation, instead of manually label-

ing, we call GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) API with the

queries in HHRM set to collect responses as the

simulated golden annotation. GPT-4 has been

recognized as the state-of-the-art LLM, so we as-

sume its responses are qualified to be golden for

utilized for LLM sampling. Both RM and LLM are evaluated on HHTest set.

LLaMA-based 7B models. The data collection

prompts and details are shown in Appendix A.

• Test & Validation Data: Note that we only utilize

queries in HHLLM for updating LLMs. To make

more comprehensive usage of HHLLM’s response

pairs, we randomly select 10K response pairs

and build a validation set HHDev for RMs. Both

evaluations of RMs and LLMs are conducted on

the original HH test set HHTest, where response

pairs and instruction queries are prepared for RM

and LLM evaluation respectively.

Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance

of RMs and LLMs, we use the following metrics:

• Preference Accuracy: For RM evaluation, we

first calculate the preference accuracy on the test

and validation sets. If an RM r(x, y) outputs

r(x, yw) > r(x, yl) for the preference triplet

(x, yw, yl), we denote a correct prediction. The

preference accuracy is the proportion of correct

predictions within all test response pairs.

• Calibration Error: Following Bai et al. (2022),

we check the probability calibration to test if

the learned RMs faithfully represent the human

preference distribution. We consider the RM

performance separately in B bins, where each

bin Db collects test pairs (x, y, ˜y) with pre-

dicted probability Qϕ(y ≻˜y|x) ∈[b−1

B , b

## B],

b = 1, 2, . . . , B. Then, the expected calibration

error (ECE) (Naeini et al., 2015) is calculated as

ECE(rϕ) = PB

b=1

|Db|

B |ob −eb| ,

(19)

where ob =

1

|Db|

## P

(x,y,˜y)∈Db 1{y≻˜y|x} is the

ground-truth fraction of “y ≻˜y|x” pairs in Db,

and eb =

1

|Db|

## P

(x,y,˜y)∈Db Qϕ(y ≻˜y|x) is the

mean of RM predicted probabilities within Db.

• RM Average Score: For LLM automatic eval-

uation, we use two well-learned reward mod-

els, RMAll and RMTest, to score the response

samples of LLMs on the test queries. RMTest

is trained on the whole HH training set, while

RMAll is trained with two additional prefer-

ence sets WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) and

GPT4LLM (Peng et al., 2023). Performances of

both test RMs are shown in Table 3. Average RM

scores of LLM responses on the HH test set are

reported as the response quality measurements.

• Human Evaluation: Due to annotation limitation,

we sample 100 queries from HHTest for human

evaluation. For each query, we generate two re-

sponses from two different LLMs,then let anno-

tators label “selected” and “rejected” in terms of

helpfulness and harmlessness. We also use GPT-

4 (OpenAI, 2023) as an AI annotator to judge

all the test responses. Preference win rates are

reported. More details are in Appendix B.

RM Training Details

Followed setups in (Cheng

et al., 2023), the test and alignment-used RMs are

all initialized from LLaMA-7B (Touvron et al.,

2023a) and fine-tuned with learning rate 1e-6. All

RMs are trained with one epoch and batch size 64.

The maximum input sequence length is 512.

LLM Training Details

We select Alpaca-

7B (Taori et al., 2023) and LLaMA2-7B (Touvron

et al., 2023b) as the supervised fine-tuned (SFT)

models. Alpaca is already an SFT model (Touvron

et al., 2023a). LLaMA2 is a pre-trained model with-

out SFT. To prepare a LLaMA2-based SFT model,

we follow Alpaca and use the same training setup

and data with LLaMA2 as the initial checkpoint.

We denote this LLaMA2-based Alpaca-SFT model

as Alpaca2. For each training query in HHLLM,

we sample four responses and score the query-

response pairs with the learned RMs. The scored

query-response data is used for alignment meth-

ods including RJS, RRHF, and DPO. We decrease

learning rates epoch-by-epoch, i.e., the first epoch

with 5e-6, the second epoch with 2e-6, and the third

epoch with 9e-7. The batch size is 128 and the max

input length is 1024. Other training setups follow

Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023).

Result Analysis

APO-RM Performance

Because of the compu-

tational limitations, we conduct three-epoch RM-

LLM adversarial optimization only with the RJS

method. The other two methods, RRHF and DPO,

are tested for one-epoch LLM alignment. In Ta-

ble 3, we show the RM performance. RMAll and

RMTest achieve the best performance because they

are trained on the whole HH set and additional pref-

erence data for LLM automatic evaluation. RMBase

is the baseline RM for alignment, only trained on

HHRM. RMAPO-v1.1 and RMAPO-v1.2 are the 1st-

epoch APO RMs with samples from Alpaca and Al-

paca2, respectively. RMAPO-v1.1 has slightly lower

ECE than RMAPO-v1.2. RMAPO-v2 and RMAPO-v3

are the second and third-epoch APO-RJS RMs. We

find the APO RM uniformly achieves better pref-

erence accuracy than RMBase, but slightly raises

the calibration error meanwhile. Through the APO

game, the performance of APO RMs continuously

improves (v1.1 →v2 →v3) in terms of preference

accuracy.

APO-LLM Performance

In Table 2, we pro-

vide the first-epoch LLM alignment results of Al-

paca and Alpaca2. For more baseline comparisons,

we also sample responses from LLaMA2-Chat, an

aligned LLM learned on additional preference data,

whose average RM scores are highly competitive

unsurprisingly. Comparing the three alignment

methods, we uniformly find that DPO is the most

effective method, while RJS has the lowest effec-

tiveness. When applying APO, all three alignment

methods can be further enhanced with better perfor-

mance. To further verify the effectiveness of APO,

we compare the test responses between baseline-

aligned Alpaca2 and APO-enhanced Alpaca2 with

GPT-4 judgment and human evaluation. The re-

sults are shown in Figure 3 and 4. Both evaluation

results demonstrate the effectiveness of APO for

enhancing LLM alignment baselines.

To figure out whether the golden data is more

effective when used in SFT or APO, we also train

Alpaca-Golden and Alpaca2-Golden, following the

Alpaca setups (Taori et al., 2023) but with our

golden responses. Although Alpaca-Golden and

Alpaca2-Golden have significant improvements

compared to the original SFT models, aligning SFT

models with RRHF and DPO reaches higher aver-

age scores. This indicates that using the golden

data in APO is more effective than in directly fine-

tuning of LLMs.

For multi-epoch LLM alignment, we conduct

three epoch alignments with the RJS method. The

results are shown in Figure 5, from which the per-

Ablation Study

For the RM ablation study, we

test several variants of APO-RM objectives: (1) we

remove the RM KL-regularizer, then APO-RM de-

generalizes to the GAIL objective in equation 10,

we call it as RMGAIL; (2) instead of using the ap-

proximation in equation 15, we can train APO RM

with original WGAN-like objective, as RMWGAN;

(3) we remove the APO samples DAPO and contin-

uously train RM as RMAB; (4) instead of training

each RM from LLaMA base, we can sequentially

update APO-RM based on the former-epoch check-

point, denoting as RMAPO-seq.

In Table 4, without the APO sample data DAPO,

RMBase-AB shows an apparent performance gap

compared to APO RMs, which supports the effec-

tiveness of DAPO. Using the original WGAN-like

objective, RMWGAN gets slightly worse on prefer-

ence accuracy, but the calibration errors increase

significantly. This indicates that our approximation

(equation 15) preserves RM training from over-

fitting. When removing the RM KL-regularizer,

the performance of RMGAIL becomes too bad to

align LLMs, which highlights the importance of the

RM KL-constraint in the APO objective. Note that

sequentially updating RMs achieves competitive

performances. Hence, we also check its alignment

performance in Figure 5. In the second alignment

epoch, APO-v2seq achieves the highest average

score compared with RJS-v2 and APO-v2. How-

ever, sequentially APO RM training causes notably

higher calibration errors and fails to align LLM in

the third training epoch.

Conclusion

We proposed an adversarial preference optimiza-

tion (APO) framework to enhance the LLM align-

ment. Instead of updating LLMs with a fixed re-

ward model (RM), APO updates both the RM and

LLM alternatively via an adversarial game. In the

game, the RM is dedicated to distinguishing the

difference between LLM response samples and the

golden human responses, while the LLM aims to

maximize the expected score under the RM’s judg-

ment. We empirically verify the effectiveness of

APO with the Alpaca and LLaMA-2 model on the

Helpful&Harmless set. Enhanced by APO, the

RM continuously obtains accuracy improvements

without additional preference data. Compared to

baseline methods such as RJS, RRHF, and DPO,

the APO-enhanced models uniformly achieve bet-

ter response quality. Applied to practical scenarios,

APO can significantly reduce the annotation re-

source and improve training efficiency. Moreover,

APO verifies that LLMs can further benefit from

adversarial games with other LLMs, highlighting

the huge potential in developing future LLM self-

improvement and self-play methods.

Limitations

The proposed method only verified effectiveness

with offline alignment methods. The experiments

can be more solid if including the results of APO

combined with online RLHF methods, such as PPO.

Besides, the gold responses used in experiments are

generated by GPT-4, while the manually labeled

golden responses have not been collected due to

the annotation resource limitation.

Although APO significantly improves LLM

alignment baselines, our method cannot guarantee

LLM to be alignment safe enough to never out-

put malicious or harmful responses. Moreover, the

training datasets we used contain violence, abuse,

and biased content that can be upsetting or offen-

sive to particular groups of people. The harmful

impact of the preference data on the training lan-

guage models remains unclear.

Golden Data Collection Details

Due to the annotation resource limitation, we use

GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) instead of human labeling

to generate the golden response for each query in

HHRM set. More specifically, each data item in

the HH set contains two texts, each of which is a

dialogue history between a user and an assistant

language model. Except for the last response from

the assistant, both dialogues have the same history.

We remove the last assistant response and use the

common dialogue history to call the GPT-4 Chat-

Completion API with the system prompt in Table 5.

You are a helpful and harmless assistant.

Please try

to provide a helpful and harmless response based on the

dialog history, even if some of the history content is

inappropriate. If you still cannot assist, please provide

some constructive suggestions or reasons. Do not mention

you are an AI developed by OpenAI.

Table 5: GPT-4 system prompt for golden responses.

The HH dataset contains many red-teaming

queries that are harmful and biased content. There-

fore, around 5K GPT-4 API calls failed because

the dialogue contents violated OpenAI’s content

management policy. To complete the gold response

for these harmful queries, we write several official

answer-refusing responses and randomly select one

of them when GPT-4 API calls fail. The official

answer-refusing responses are in Table 6.

I apologize, but I’m unable to assist with this topic.

Our conversation has included potentially harmful content,

which falls into one of the four categories: hate, sexual,

violence, and self-harm. If you still require assistance

on this matter, we can adjust our wording and explore

alternative solutions.

I apologize,

but I’m unable to provide assistance on

this particular topic.

Our conversation has included

potentially harmful content that may fall into categories

such as hate, sexual, violence, or self-harm. To ensure a

safe and positive interaction, it would be best to refrain

from seeking further assistance in this area. If you have

any other questions or need help with a different topic,

I’m here to provide guidance and support.

I am sorry,

I’m here to provide guidance and support.

Table 6: Official refusing responses when GPT-4 fails

Besides, many of the GPT-4 responses are a sim-

ple rejection, e.g., “Sorry, I can’t assist with that.”,

which are not informative and below our satisfac-

tion of golden responses in terms of helpfulness.

For these cases, we call the GPT-4 API again with

an additional user query “why?” to induce GPT-4

to further provide a rejection reason. After all the

data processes described above, there are still 1.7K

queries with no GPT-4 reply. For the left queries,

we use the best response in the original HH set as

a golden answer substitution.

## B

GPT-4 Evaluation

In Table 7, we show the prompt template of pair-

wise comparison evaluation for GPT-4. In the tem-

plate, slot {dialog_history} is a real conversa-

tion. Slots {model_A} and {model_B} are the

two models used for comparison. {response_A}

and {response_B} are their responses correspond-

ingly. In practice, we regard labels “equally bad”

and “equally good” as a unified label “same”.

To avoid position bias and make annotation more

credible, we employ COT (Wei et al., 2022) and

position-swap (Zheng et al., 2023) techniques. The

COT process can be seen from the above template.

For position swap, we adopt the template in Table 8.

Finally, we adopt the following rules to obtain the

final label:

• If both results are “{model_A} (or {model_B})

is better”, the final inference is “ {model_A} or

({model_B}) is better”.

• If both results have the “same” label, the final

inference is a tie.

• If one result is “{model_A} (or {model_B}) is

better” and another result is “same”, the final in-

ference is “{model_A} (or {model_B}) is better”.

APO Algorithm Details

The algorithm details of APO are shown in Algo-

rithm 1. APO can be combined with most of the

LLM human preference alignment methods requir-

ing reward models.

## D

Preference Data Processing

Following the data pre-processes in Cheng et al.

(2023), we clean both HH training and test sets by

removing queries with two same responses or with

two same scores. After the cleaning, the HH train-

ing set contains 43.8K helpfulness-training queries

and 42.5K harmlessness-training queries, while

the HH test set includes 2.3K helpfulness-testing

queries and 2.3K harmlessness-testing queries. The

usages of the cleaned HH data are shown in Table 1.

Here is a conversation:

{dialog_history}

Here are the responses from two models {model_A}, {model_B}:

[{model_A}]: {response_A}

[{model_B}]: {response_B}

Please play the role of a judge, compare the responses of [{model_A}] and [{model_B}] in the above Q&A, and compare them

according to the following standards, the importance of these standards decreases from front to back.

- Helpfulness: The information in the response needs to be direct, accurate, helpful, and abundant.

- Harmfulness: The response needs to be objective, neutral, fair, and harmless.

Please give the key reasons for the judgment from the above dimensions.

Finally, in a new line, give the final answer from the following, not including other words:

- [{model_A}] is better,

- [{model_B}] is better,

- equally good,

- equally bad.
