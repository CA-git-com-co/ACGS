Abstract

Reward models are widely used as proxies for

human preferences when aligning or evaluating

LLMs. However, reward models are black boxes,

and it is often unclear what they are actually re-

warding. In this paper, we develop Rewrite-based

Attribute Treatment Estimator (RATE) as an ef-

fective method for measuring the sensitivity of a

reward model to high-level attributes of responses,

such as sentiment, helpfulness, or complexity. Im-

portantly, RATE measures the causal effect of

an attribute on the reward. RATE uses LLMs to

rewrite responses to produce imperfect counterfac-

tual examples that can be used to measure causal

effects. A key challenge is that these rewrites are

imperfect in a manner that can induce substan-

tial bias in the estimated sensitivity of the reward

model to the target attribute. The core idea of

RATE is to adjust for this imperfect-rewrite effect

by rewriting twice. We establish the validity of

the RATE procedure and show empirically that

it is an effective estimator. Code is available at

1. Introduction

Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large

language models (LLMs) with desired behaviors. These

models evaluate the quality of LLM outputs and are widely

used in, e.g., post-training, inference-time sampling adjust-

ment (through best-of-n sampling), and LLM evaluation.

However, reward models, typically implemented as fine-

tuned LLMs, are black boxes. Accordingly, it can be diffi-

cult to understand what a reward model is actually rewarding.

Despite their importance, explainability research for RMs

remains underexplored (Lambert et al., 2024).

To understand reward models, we would like to be able

to measure their responsiveness to high-level attributes of

responses, such as helpfulness, correctness, or sentiment.

The ability to measure the responsiveness of an RM to an

attribute would serve as an important diagnostic tool, and

the purpose of this paper is to develop such a measurement

procedure.

Naively, one might attempt to estimate RM responsiveness

to an attribute by comparing the average reward assigned to

responses with and without the attribute, using a labeled

dataset. However, this approach is flawed: it conflates

the target attribute’s influence with correlations present in

the evaluation data. For instance, suppose we are measur-

ing how much an RM responds to “sentiment” and, unbe-

knownst to us, highly-negative samples in our evaluation

data tend to have more typos and sloppy formatting. Then

if we naively average the reward over the negative samples,

and again over the positive samples, we’ll inadvertently

measure the effect of not just sentiment, but typos and for-

matting as well. In particular, this means we can measure

a large effect of an attribute on the RM, even if the RM is

completely insensitive to that attribute.

For measurements of attribute influence to be meaningful,

they must be isolated from confounding factors and spurious

correlations in the evaluation data. To address this, we

propose formalizing RM explainability as the causal effects

of attributes on the reward. Hence, the goal is to determine

how a reward would change if we could modify a response

to alter only the attribute of interest while holding all other

factors constant. This counterfactual perspective isolates

the causal relationship, making it possible to disentangle an

attribute’s true effect from confounding factors.

Notice that, if we had access to counterfactual pairs of re-

sponses (i.e., pairs where the only difference is the attribute

of interest), we could estimate the target effect by simply

comparing the rewards assigned to each response. A natural

idea is to use LLMs to generate such counterfactualpairs by

rewriting responses to change only the target attribute. If the

rewrites were perfect, we could directly measure the causal

effect of the attribute on the reward. However, in practice,

LLMs produce imperfect rewrites, changing off-target at-

tributes as well. These imperfections can substantially bias

the estimated causal effect, as we will see in Section 5.

RATE: Causal Explainability of Reward Models with Imperfect Counterfactuals

Figure 1. When generating counterfactual pairs, LLMs change other attributes, such as tone, length, or grammar. Empirically, using the

rewrites of rewrites corrects for this bias. (Left) Naively sampling pairs which differ on the attribute of interest (e.g., sentiment) will lead

to a biased estimate of the causal effect because other attributes may also change. (Middle) When we rewrite a response to change the

attribute of interest (e.g., from positive to negative sentiment), the LLM may also change other attributes, such as fixing typos. (Right)

Rewriting the rewritten response again tends to cancel out these off-target changes, in a manner we make precise in Section 3.

There is a growing literature on estimating the causal effects

of attributes of text (Feder et al., 2022; Grimmer et al.,

2022; Jin et al., 2022; Chen & Chu, 2023; Gui & Veitch,

2023). Generally, this work provide methods for estimating

causal effects by either making strong assumptions on the

evaluation data or compensating for potential confounding

factors.

Note that our question fundamentally differs from the simi-

larly named counterfactual explanation paradigm (Wachter

et al., 2018) studied recently in the context of reward models

by Jiang et al. (2024). While counterfactual explanations

aim to explain the behavior of a model by finding a mini-

mally perturbed input that changes the model’s output, we

are interested in measuring the average treatment effect of

an attribute on the assigned reward, as measured across

many counterfactual pairs.

The contribution of this paper is to develop a procedure that

allows us to use the imperfect rewrites from LLMs to get

a correct estimate of the causal effect of an attribute on a

reward model. The development is as follows:

1. We formalize RM explainability as an Average Treat-

ment Effect (ATE) of high-level attributes of responses,

on the reward assigned to that response.

2. We develop a measurement procedure (RATE) which

utilizes two imperfect rewrites to estimate the ATE

without needing to explicitly list confounding factors

in the evaluation dataset.

3. We show that RATE provides a valid estimation of the

true causal effect under mild assumptions.

4. We empirically demonstrate that RATE correctly esti-

mates causal effects, while the naive and single-rewrite

baselines are highly influenced by spurious associa-

tions. We also show that this causal-vs-correlational

problem substantially affects the explanations of lead-

ing reward models using common benchmarks.

2. Setup

A reward function R is a function that takes a prompt x and a

response y as inputs and return a real number indicating the

quality of the response for the prompt.1 To develop an eval-

uation procedure, we begin with a fixed dataset of prompt-

completion pairs {(xi, yi)}, where the xi are prompts and

the yi are completions (also referred to as “responses”). We

are interested in understanding how the reward model re-

sponds to a certain attribute W (such as sentiment or length).

We consider the case where each prompt-completion pair is

labelled with wi = W(xi, yi) ∈{0, 1} indicating whether

the completion has the attribute of interest.2

We focus on binary attributes for simplicity—many at-

tributes of interest can often be naturally binarized.

Naive Method

If we want to measure the sensitivity of

a given reward model to an attribute of interest, such as

helpfulness, the obvious approach is to take the dataset of

prompt-completion pairs, label each completion as helpful

1A reward function can also be viewed as taking two responses

and returning a relative preference between them; our results ex-

tend easily to this case as well.

2We include the prompt x in the argument of W because the

attribute may be prompt-dependent. For example, W might repre-

sent helpfulness, which varies based on the context given by the

prompt. A recipe could be helpful for questions about cooking but

not for questions about history.

or unhelpful, then check whether the rewards for the helpful

responses are higher than the rewards for the unhelpful re-

sponses. Mathematically, we define this average conditional

reward difference as:

ˆτnaive = 1

n1

## X

(xi,yi):wi=1

R(xi, yi)−1

n0

## X

(xi,yi):wi=0

R(xi, yi)

where n1 and n0 are the numbers of examples with W = 1

and W = 0, respectively.

This estimates the correlation between the reward and W,

E[R(X, Y ) | W = 1] −E[R(X, Y ) | W = 0],

where the expectation is taken over the distribution from

which our evaluation examples are drawn. The problem

here is that, even in the infinite data limit, this quantity does

not generally isolate the effect of W on R. For instance, if

the procedure we use to collect the evaluation data has a

correlation between helpfulness and length, then the effect

of these attributes will be conflated in the naive estimator

(see Figure 1, middle). Consequently, we will misinterpret

the true behavior of the reward model.

Treatment Effects

To isolate the effect of a given attribute

on the reward model, we must take a causal perspective.

Concretely, we can formalize the responsiveness of a reward

model to some attribute W as the average treatment effect

(ATE) of W on the reward:

## Ate = E[R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))]

(1)

where X is a random variable for the prompt, and Y (1) and

Y (0) are potential outcomes for responses. This quantity is

the expected change in reward if we were to change the at-

tribute W from 0 to 1, while keeping all other aspects of the

response fixed. The random pair of responses (Y (0), Y (1))

are identical in all aspects except for the attribute W—e.g.,

if W is helpfulness then each counterfactual response should

have the same writing style, sentiment, topic, etc. In general,

we only observe one of the counterfactual responses in our

dataset (Figure 1, left)—this is the fundamental problem of

causal inference (Imbens & Rubin, 2015).

Choice of Estimand

Beyond the ATE, we will also con-

sider the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and

the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU),

ATT = E [R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))|W = 1]

ATU = E [R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))|W = 0]

Intuitively, if W = 1 is a helpful response, the ATT mea-

sures the change in reward when we take a helpful response

and make it unhelpful, and the ATU measures the change

in reward when we take an unhelpful response and make it

helpful. These estimands can differ substantially from each

other and from the ATE (see Figure 8 in Appendix D.1).

There is no reason to expect these quantities to align in gen-

eral, so thought should be given to which is most relevant

to the question at hand. Indeed, even human preferences

are often asymmetric (Kahneman & Tversky, 2013), so we

might expect reward model preferences to be as well.

3. Rewrite-based Attribute Treatment

Estimator (RATE)

Whatever our choice of estimand, we need a method to

estimate it. Here, we develop a method, RATE, that uses

rewrites to estimate the causal effect of an attribute on a

reward model. The core idea is to create pairs of responses

where the only difference is in the attribute of interest, even

if the rewrites are imperfect.

Rewrites With LLMs

In practice, we implement rewrites

using a large language model (LLM) (see Table 1). We

begin with a labeled dataset containing ground truth binary

variables for attributes such as complexity, sentiment, or

helpfulness. We then instruct the LLM to rewrite the re-

sponses to the opposite state of the binary variable. For

example, we may instruct: “Rewrite this response to express

negative sentiment and change nothing else.”

We use Re(xi, yi, w) to denote the rewrite operation, which

takes a prompt-response pair (xi, yi) and a desired at-

tribute value w, returning a modified response ˜yi such that

W(xi, ˜yi) = w. When xi is clear from context, we drop

it for brevity and write the operation as Re(yi, w), even

though the rewriter in general may depend on the input

prompt.

Rewrite Instructions

There is significant flexibility in

how to instruct an LLM to rewrite.

For instance, when rewriting for “helpfulness”, we might

instruct the LLM to “Rewrite this response to be more help-

ful”, or instruct it to “Rewrite this response to be more

helpful, providing additional relevant information or clarifi-

cation.” In this example, the second instruction makes the

meaning of “helpful” more precise. Generally, changing the

instruction changes the nature of the rewrites generated, and

thus changes the attribute that is being modified.

Ambiguity in interventions is unavoidable in causal infer-

ence (Hern´an, 2016). In our context, there is subjectivity in

what helpfulness, complexity, or sentiment actually mean.

An advantage of rewrite instructions is that we can use natu-

ral language to specify, as clearly as possible, what property

we are trying to modify. We can understand whether our in-

structions are having the intended effect by qualitatively ex-

Table 1. Recent language models show promise as (imperfect) rewriters, since, qualitatively, they are capable of following instructions to

change a target attribute (even if they do not always leave off-target attributes unchanged). For instance, GPT-4o qualitatively does well at

rewriting IMDB responses to change sentiment from negative (W = 0) to positive (W = 1). However, this does not ensure that GPT-4o will

not change other attributes besides sentiment.

amining the rewritten outputs and checking that they indeed

change the target attribute. In practice, finding effective

rewrite instructions requires an iterative cycle of generating

rewrites, examining the responses, and adjusting the rewrite

prompt to be more clear and specific.

Imperfect Rewrites

While qualitative checks help con-

firm whether the target attribute has changed, they are less

effective for detecting off-target modifications—unintended

edits to grammar, tone, or other attributes (see Table 2).

For example, in Table 1 (and Appendix E.3), sentiment

flips successfully, but other properties may also shift. This

issue can be identified quantitatively by comparing reward

distributions before and after rewriting (Figure 2). Ideally, if

only sentiment changed during rewriting, a second rewrite

reversing the attribute should restore the original distribution.

Otherwise, the (original, rewrite) pairs are not perfectly

counterfactual and cannot directly estimate Equation (1).

Mathematically, rewriting introduces some error ϵi

w in the

observed reward because we cannot perfectly construct the

true counterfactual yi(w), which differs only on the target

attribute:

ϵi

w = R(xi, Re(yi, w)) −R(xi, yi(w))

(2)

We would like to correct for these errors. Yet, the whole

point of the rewrites is to approximate the counterfactuals

yi(w), so we cannot directly measure ϵi

w.

RATE Procedure

Our solution is to introduce more noise.

Instead of comparing a rewrite to the original response, we

compare it to the rewrite of the rewrite, thereby canceling

out off-target noise introduced by the rewrite process. That

is, rather than selecting (original, rewrite):

˜δi =

(

R(xi, yi) −R(xi, Re(yi, 0)),

if wi = 1

R(xi, Re(yi, 1)) −R(xi, yi),

if wi = 0

Figure 2. Off-target changes from imperfect rewrites affect the re-

ward measurement. Ideally, if rewrites affected only the target

attribute (sentiment), then applying a second rewrite to revert the

change should restore the original reward distribution. Unfor-

tunately, the observed distribution shift indicates that off-target

modifications occur during rewriting. Here, the original samples

(blue) are drawn from the HH-RLHF dataset, and are rewritten

twice on sentiment (orange). Rewards are from ArmoRM.

we instead compare the (rewrites, rewrites of rewrites) pairs:

δi =























R(xi, Re(Re(yi, 0), 1)) −R(xi, Re(yi, 0)),

if wi = 1

R(xi, Re(yi, 1)) −R(xi, Re(Re(yi, 1), 0)),

if wi = 0

The motivation is that the off-target changes introduced by

the rewrite process will, in expectation, cancel out when we

are comparing two things in “rewrite space”. For example,

the tendency for LLMs to produce well-formatted text will

affect both the first rewrite and the rewrite of the rewrite

(see Table 2), so the overall contribution of this off-target

change will cancel out.

In Algorithm 1 we use this idea to define the Rewrite-based

Attribute Treatment Estimators (RATE) for the ATT, ATU,

and ATE. These estimators are simply the averages of the

reward difference between the rewrites and the rewrites of

the rewrites.

4. Cancellation of Multiple Rewrite Errors

We now turn to the validity of the RATE procedure. Intu-

itively, the idea is that, as long as the errors introduced by

the rewrite are independent of the target attribute W, then

these errors will cancel out when we compute the average. A

particularly important special case of independence is when

the LLM always introduces the same error, irrespective the

rewrite direction. For example, we observe that GPT-4o

rewrites nearly always correct typos, independent of the

attribute being rewritten. In this case, the single-rewrite

estimator is biased because it includes the effect of the typo

correction. RATE, however, is not, because it compares

typo-corrected responses to typo-corrected responses. We

now formalize these intuitions.

Latent Variable Model for the Responses

We can parti-

tion all the possible high-level attributes of a response into

three categories: the target attribute W we want to change

(e.g. sentiment), off-target attributes Z which are always

unaffected by the rewrite (e.g. topic, and language), and

off-target attributes which might end up being affected by

the rewrite (e.g. grammatical structure), which we’ll denote

ξ. We write the response as Y = Y (W, Z, ξ).

Assumption 1: Rewrite Errors Don’t Noticeably Depend

on the Rewrite Direction

The off-target changes, ˜ξ, in-

troduced by the rewrite process are randomly drawn from

some distribution, PRe which doesn’t depend on W:

Re(X, Y (W, Z, ξ), 1 −W)

d= Y (1 −W, Z, ˜ξ)

with ˜ξ ∼PRe(˜ξ)

Continuing the example where rewriting sentiment (W)

corrects typos (ξ) but leaves language (Z) unchanged, this

states that GPT-4o isn’t more or less likely to fix typos on

positive sentiment responses compared to negative senti-

ment. Note that this is, in fact, weaker than assuming that

LLM-rewriters tend to repeat the same rewrite errors (e.g.

GPT-4o always fixes typos no matter what). If we do ob-

serve this behavior, then the assumption is trivially satisfied.

Assumption 2: Additivity of Reward with Respect to

Rewrite Errors

Suppose that the reward function can be

decomposed additively into two components:

R(X, Y (W, Z, ξ)) = RW,Z(X, W, Z) + Rξ(X, ξ)

where:

1. RW,Z(X, W, Z) is the component of the reward that

depends on the target attribute W and the immutable

off-target attributes Z.

2. Rξ(X, ξ) is the component of the reward that depends

on the mutable off-target attributes ξ.

Intuitively, this assumption is saying that, at the level of

the reward model, there aren’t any interactions between the

component corresponding to potential rewrite-errors ξ and

either W or Z.

The following result establishes validity of RATE under

these assumptions:

Theorem 4.1 (Unbiasedness and Consistency of RATE).

Assume R(·, ·) is bounded. Take assumptions 1 and 2 above.

Suppose we have a set of prompt-completion pairs {xi, yi}

sampled i.i.d. from some population with P(W = 1) ∈

(0, 1). Then Algorithm 1 yields unbiased and √n-consistent

estimators of the ATT, ATU, and ATE.

See Appendix B for the proof. We emphasize that these

are merely sufficient conditions to show that there exist

any situations under which RATE is consistent. There’s no

reason a priori to expect that imperfect rewrites can provide

a causal estimation. Hence, the purpose of the theorem is

simply to show that the approach is not vacuous.

5. Experiments

There are two main questions to address empirically:

1. Does RATE correctly estimate the causal effect of at-

tributes on reward models?

2. Is the distinction between RATE and the naive estima-

tor actually substantive?

Table 2. We introduce a correlation between whether the example “starts with a vowel” (W = 1) and the percentage of words with typos

to test double vs single rewrites. In this example, we have added typos to 30% of words, but only to IMDB reviews that start with a vowel.

In row one, we see that the original example that starts with a vowel and has typos is penalized by the reward model, while the rewrite of

the rewrite has typos fixed and its reward score is the same as the rewrite. Examples that do not start with a vowel (W = 0) do not have

typos introduced and the reward score is similar for the original, the rewrite, and the rewrite of the rewrite. This correlation introduces a

spurious positive change in reward when rewriting from “starts with a vowel” to “doesn’t start with a vowel,” yielding a negatively biased

estimator for the causal effect of “starts with a vowel” on reward score. Results as the percent of typos is varied are reported in Figure 3.

Answering the first question requires knowing ground truth

causal effects. To this end, we design semi-synthetic experi-

ments with known ground truth. In this setting, we find that

RATE is effective at estimating the true effects, while the

naive and single-rewrite estimators fail.

We note that a quantitative evaluation, as outlined in Sec-

tion 5.1, can be performed to determine whether rewrite

errors cancel out during estimation with the double-rewrite

estimator. If they do not, sensitivity to correlations between

on-target and off-target attributes would be observed.

The second question is whether the correctness of the RATE

estimator over the naive estimator actually matters in prac-

tice. We find that across a variety of reward models, at-

tributes, and datasets, the RATE estimates differ substan-

tially from the naive baseline (see Figure 5). Accordingly,

the distinction between RATE and the naive estimator is

indeed important. As a particular example, the RATE es-

timator shows that the phenomenon of “length bias” in re-

wards may actually be mainly an artifact of bias in naive

evaluations.

Setup

For all experiments, we use OpenAI BatchAPI

to generate rewrites of text, instructing the LLM to mod-

ify the target attribute without changing any other as-

pects of the response (see Appendix E.1).

We use the

gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model, incurring a cost of $1.25

per 1M input tokens and $5.00 per 1M output tokens. For

instance, generating rewrites and rewrites-of-rewrites for

25K IMDB samples cost roughly $60. See Appendix E for

additional implementation details and rewrite samples.

5.1. Semi-synthetic Experiments

Correlation between Typos and “Starts with a Vowel”

To test the efficacy of RATE against a known ground

truth, we design a synthetic experiment where we intro-

duce typos into IMDB review examples (Maas et al., 2011)

that correlate with whether or not the review starts with

a vowel (see Table 2).

We score the examples using

FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-v0.1 (Dong et al., 2023) with

the prompt: “Write a movie review: ”. We expect the true

ATE of “starts with a vowel” on the reward model to be near

zero. Additionally, the true effect should not interact with

whether there are typos in the review.

The naive estimator (Section 2) uses only the original re-

sponses; the single-rewrite estimator (Section 3) uses (origi-

nal, rewrite) pairs, while the RATE estimator (Algorithm 1)

uses (rewrite, rewritten rewrite) pairs.

As seen in Table 2, GPT-4o corrects typos even when not

asked to, which, we predict, introduces bias for the single-

rewrite estimator. By artificially correlating typos with

“starts with a vowel” in the dataset, the single-rewrite proce-

dure ought to demonstrate a positive bias to the change in

reward score when examples are rewritten to start with a con-

sonant (since typos harm the reward score). This results in a

negatively biased estimate of the treatment effect of “starts

with a vowel”—the estimation procedure views “starts with

a vowel” as harming the reward score of an example.

## Page 7

RATE: Causal Explainability of Reward Models with Imperfect Counterfactuals

Figure 3. In a situation where the ground truth is known,

RATE (orange) accurately estimates the ground truth while

the naive (blue) and single-rewrite (green) estimators do not.

We calculate the treatment effect of “Starts with a vowel” on

FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-v0.1, when typos have been added

with varying frequency to IMDB reviews which start with vowels

(see Table 2). Intuitively, we expect the RM to respond negatively

to the presence of typos, but not to respond at all to whether the

movie review starts with a vowel. Hence the treatment effect for

”starts with vowel” should remain zero, even as the spurious corre-

lation increases. 95% confidence intervals are shown.

In Figure 3, we see that this bias does in fact occur, and

increases for both the single rewrite method and the naive

estimator as we introduce a higher percentage of typos in

examples that start with a vowel. On the other hand, the

double rewrite method reports a near-zero treatment effect,

even as we increase the percentage of typos in the “starts

with a vowel” reviews. This demonstrates the necessity of

RATE’s double-rewrite correction.

Treatment Effect of Length on a Sentiment Classifier

As a second test of RATE, we use a DistilBERT senti-

ment classifier (Socher et al., 2013; Sanh et al., 2020) as a

“reward model” since it has the same structure of taking in

text and returning a scalar. The benefit of using a sentiment

classifier is that it should only be sensitive to the sentiment

of the text, not other attributes (e.g. length). Intuitively,

the average treatment effect of length corresponds to asking

“how much do longer responses impact the likelihood that

the DistilBERT model classifies the review as having

positive sentiment?” We expect this to be close to zero (as-

suming no strong correlation between length and sentiment

in the classifier’s training data); regardless, the true ATE

should be invariant to distributional shift as we increase the

correlation between length and positive sentiment.

We induce this correlation by partitioning the IMDB dataset

(Maas et al., 2011) into four categories: long positive, short

positive, long negative, and short negative reviews. We then

downsample each category, keeping the total number of

Figure 4. Treating a sentiment classifier as a “reward model” gives

us an approximate ground truth for the effect of length on sentiment

classification. We see that the naive estimator (blue) is again

highly sensitive to distributional shift, while both the single-rewrite

(green) and RATE (orange) estimators correctly report near zero

effects. RATE remains invariant to distributional shift, while the

single-rewrite estimator reports an increasingly negative effect as

the correlation between length and positive sentiment increases.

95% confidence intervals are shown.

samples constant (n = 9374) while increasing the correla-

tion between length and positive sentiment (see Table 3 in

Appendix C.2). We then compute the naive, single-rewrite,

and RATE estimators on each of the resulting datasets.

The naive estimator is highly responsive to spurious correla-

tions, while both the single-rewrite estimator and RATE re-

port near-zero treatment effects even in the regime of strong

correlation (Figure 4). Noteably, RATE remains invariant

to distributional shift, while the single-rewrite estimator

reports an increasingly negative effect as the correlation

between length and positive sentiment increases.

If we instead replace the sentiment classifer with a general

reward model, we can perform a similar test for invariance

to distributional shift, just without knowing the ground truth

effect. In Appendix C.1, we reproduce similar results while

varying the correlation between complexity and helpfulness

in the HelpSteer dataset (Wang et al., 2023). We find that

the naive estimator is highly sensitive to distributional shift,

while the RATE estimator remains invariant.

5.2. Real World Reward Models

We select several of the top-performing reward models from

RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) and evaluate them

using both RATE and the naive method across a variety of

attributes and datasets: IMDB (Maas et al., 2011), ELI5

(Fan et al., 2019), HelpSteer (Wang et al., 2023).

RATE: Causal Explainability of Reward Models with Imperfect Counterfactuals

Figure 5. An attribute’s reported effect on a reward model differs substantially between the naive (blue) estimator compared to the RATE

(orange) estimator. Across reward models, the naive estimator yields much larger effect estimates for length, complexity, and helpfulness;

and smaller effect estimates for sentiment. Effect sizes are reported as standardized mean differences, using Cohen’s d to compare average

treatment effects that are normalized (Faraone, 2008). Bars represent a 95% confidence interval.

Figure 5 shows the estimated response of each reward

model to each attribute. Of particular interest are the eval-

uations of FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-v0.1 (Dong et al.,

2023) and NCSOFT (Park et al., 2024) with respect to length.

NCSOFT was designed to address several purported biases

in FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-v0.1, including length; how-

ever, the RATE estimator suggests that NCSOFT’s improve-

ment here is less than appears at first glance, and may have

inadvertently penalized other attributes like complexity.

6. Related Work

Explainability of Reward Models

Our work is particu-

larly motivated by the challenge of understanding reward

model behavior. Jiang et al. (2024) perturb text to find

changes that will flip a reward model’s prediction of the

“preferred” text example when doing pairwise comparisons—

this example-wise approach is complementary to RATE.

Lambert et al. (2024) introduced RewardBench, a dataset

for comparing reward models, providing a non-causal ap-

proach that contrasts with our causal inference framework.

Casper et al. (2023); Pan et al. (2022); Tien et al. (2023)

highlight issues such as misgeneralization, reward hack-

ing, and spurious associations in reward models, providing

motivation for the evaluation developed here.

There is also a directly relevant earlier line of work on spuri-

ousness and interpretability of text classifiers (not necessar-

ily viewed as reward models). Joshi et al. (2022) show that

spurious correlations can be categorized as “necessary” or

“sufficient” for text classifier behavior, and that many “neces-

sary but not sufficient” features interact with other features

to affect classifier behavior. Feder et al. (2021) introduced

CausaLM, which focuses on training text classifiers to “for-

get” concepts in order to estimate the treatment effect of an

attribute on classification with rule-based rewrites. To cre-

ate a benchmark for neural network explainability methods,

Abraham et al. (2022) use human-generated counterfactual

restaurant reviews to quantify the causal effect of aspect-

level sentiment (e.g., whether the ambiance was described

positively or negatively) on the sentence-level sentiment as

predicted by a neural network. RATE may be seen as a

generalization of these insights, using the double-rewrite to

allow scaling the creation of counterfactual pairs.

Using LLMs to Generate Counterfactuals

Wang et al.

(2024) survey recent methods for generating counterfactuals.

Like us, Gat et al. (2023) use LLMs to generate counter-

factuals, but they do not introduce a method to account for

imperfections in the rewrite process. Similarly, Butcher

(2024) ask an LLM to generate pairs by adding guidance to

the prompt (“respond in a kind way”) but without directly

rewriting the completions; hence there is no assurance that

the pairs share the same off-targets. Wu et al. (2021) devel-

oped Polyjuice, a system for generating diverse counterfac-

tuals to evaluate and improve models, but the focus is on

training a separate model to generate counterfactuals. Fryer

et al. (2022) use various metrics to assess the quality of

rewrites on four dimensions: fluency/consistency, presence

of a particular attribute, similarity of label, and similarity

of meaning. Our work extends assessments of rewrite qual-

ity (through rewrites of rewrites) to correct for bias in the

evaluation of reward models, allowing us to account for the

quality of rewrites on all dimensions simultaneously. Bhat-

tacharjee et al. (2024) also make the observation that frontier

models are capable of zero-shot generation of counterfac-

tual text examples capable of flipping the label of a text

classifier. They use these capabilities to both interpret and

create robustness tests for text classifiers, while we rewrite

examples on a specific “attribute” and look for a treatment

effect of that attribute on a reward model score.

7. Conclusion and Discussion

We rely on reward models to align LLMs to human values,

but reward models are black boxes and it is unclear what

aspects of the text they are actually rewarding. In this work,

we formalized whether a reward model responds to a given

attribute (e.g., helpfulness, complexity, sensitivity) through

the language of causality. Specifically, we estimated the

average treatment effect of an attribute by counterfactually

rewriting natural language responses to differ only on the

target attribute. Although this rewrite process introduces

bias, we account for it using rewrites of rewrites, which, in

expectation, cancel out off-target changes (see Figure 3).

This procedure yields RATE: Rewrite-based Attribute Treat-

ment Estimators. Empirically, we find both that RATE is

effective at estimating causal effects, and that spurious asso-

ciations cause substantial bias in naive estimators applied to

real problems of interest.

Limitations and Future Directions

RATE can only be

applied to measure the effect of attributes where a rewrite

can approximate an imperfect counterfactual. However, the

quality of counterfactuals has no ground truth, so the effec-

tiveness of the rewrite procedure is ultimately a subjective

judgment. In practice, we find this not too difficult to judge

by simply looking at the generated responses. Nevertheless,

it would be an interesting direction for future work to at-

tempt to more formally validate the rewrite quality, e.g., in

the style of Bhattacharjee et al. (2024).

RATE only addresses the effect of the attribute on the reward

model, without reference to the downstream task that the

reward model will be used for. This is both a strength and a

limitation. The strength is that it allows us to understand the

reward model in isolation, which is significant since a given

reward model may be used for many tasks. The limitation

is that it is not completely clear how the causal sensitivity

the reward model will translate to, e.g., the behavior of a

LLM aligned to this reward. Exploring this relationship fur-

ther could provide valuable insights into the role of reward

models in the alignment process.

Impact Statement

Our work is a step in the direction of more interpretable

reward models. As reward models are used to align large

language models, our work may aid in alignment. In par-

ticular, RATE may be used to check whether a particular

reward model captures desired preferences and values by

simply estimating the causal effect of attributes on rewards.

A. Reproducibility Statement

To facilitate reproducibility, we have taken the following measures: (1) Our code implementation, including scripts

for producing rewrites, estimating treatment effects, and generating plots, is provided at https://github.com/

toddnief/RATE. (2) The datasets used in our experiments (IMDB, ELI5, HelpSteer, HH RLHF) are publicly available.

(3) In Appendix E.3, we provide randomly sampled texts, rewrites, and rewrites of rewrites for each dataset/attribute

combination, allowing the reader to qualitatively evaluate our rewrites. (4) All reward models evaluated in this study

(i.e., FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-v0.1, NCSOFT/Llama-3-OffsetBias-RM-8B, ArmoRM) are open-source. (5) We

report confidence intervals for all main results to ensure statistical reliability, using a normal distribution because of our large

sample size. (6) Appendix E.1 includes tips for creating effective rewrite instructions and documents challenges encountered

during the rewrite process, aiding in the reproduction of our methodology. (7) For the synthetic experiments, we provide

details on how we induced correlations in Appendix C.2.

B. Proofs

Theorem 4.1 (Unbiasedness and Consistency of RATE). Assume R(·, ·) is bounded. Take assumptions 1 and 2 above.

Suppose we have a set of prompt-completion pairs {xi, yi} sampled i.i.d. from some population with P(W = 1) ∈(0, 1).

Then Algorithm 1 yields unbiased and √n-consistent estimators of the ATT, ATU, and ATE.

Proof. First, we’ll prove the unbiasedness and √n-consistency of d

ATTRATE. The argument for d

ATURATE follows by

symmetry. Then, we can use these results to prove the same for d

ATERATE. Throughout, we use ˜ξ and ˜˜ξ to denote i.i.d.

samples from the distribution PRe, where the former comes from the first rewrite and the latter from the rewrite of the

rewrite.

1. Unbiasedness and √n-Consistency of d

ATTRATE Fix a prompt x and response y with w = 1, omitting superscripts for

convenience. Then by our latent variable model, y = Y (1, z, v) for some realizations z and v of Z and ξ. We calculate:

R(x, Re(Re(y, 0), 1)) −R(x, Re(y, 0))

which has expected value:

E˜ξ,˜˜ξ∼PRe[R(x, y(1, z, ˜˜ξ)) −R(x, y(0, z, ˜ξ))] = E˜ξ,˜˜ξ∼PRe[RW,Z(x, 1, z) + Rξ(x, ˜˜ξ)]

−E˜ξ,˜˜ξ∼PRe[RW,Z(x, 0, z) + Rξ(x, ˜ξ)]

= RW,Z(x, 1, z) −RW,Z(x, 0, z)

= RW,Z(x, 1, z) −RW,Z(x, 0, z)

+ Rξ(x, v) −Rξ(x, v)

= R(x, y(1, z, v)) −R(x, y(0, z, v))

= R(x, y(1)) −R(x, y(0))

Therefore, as an average over these quantities, we have:

E[ d

ATTRATE] = E[R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))|W = 1] = ATT

For √n-consistency, note that R(·, ·) is bounded, so its variance is bounded. As the xi, yi are i.i.d., so are the R(xi, yi).

Thus, d

ATTRATE is an average over n1 i.i.d. random variables with finite variance, implying:

√n1( d

ATTRATE −ATT) = Op(1)

Since n1

n

p−→P(W = 1) and P(W = 1) ∈(0, 1), we have

q

n

n1 = Op(1), which implies:

√n( d

ATTRATE −ATT) = Op(1)

2. Unbiasedness and √n-Consistency of \

ATUxRATE By the same argument as for ATT and since P(W = 0) ∈(0, 1):

E[ d

ATURATE] = E[R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))|W = 0] = ATU

12

## Page 13

RATE: Causal Explainability of Reward Models with Imperfect Counterfactuals

and

√n( d

ATURATE −ATU) = Op(1)

3. Unbiasedness and √n-Consistency of d

ATERATE The ATE estimator is a weighted average of the ATT and ATU

estimators. By the law of total expectation:

E[ d

ATERATE] = E[R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))|W = 1] · P(W = 1)

+ E[R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))|W = 0] · P(W = 0)

## = E[R(X, Y (1)) −R(X, Y (0))] = Ate

For √n-consistency, we can write:

√n( d

ATERATE −ATE) = n1

n

√n( d

ATTRATE −ATT) + n0

n

√n( d

## Aturate −Atu)

Since:

n1

n

p−→P(W = 1), n0

n

p−→P(W = 0)

√n( d

ATTRATE −ATT) = Op(1), √n( d

ATURATE −ATU) = Op(1)

By Slutsky’s theorem:

√n( d

ATERATE −ATE) = Op(1)

C. Additional Semi-Synthetic Experiment Details

C.1. Additional Semi-Synthetic Experiment: HelpSteer

In a third synthetic experiment, we show that the RATE estimator is stable under distributional shift even when the expected

treatment effect is non-zero. In this experiment, we are evaluating the effect of helpfulness on the ArmoRM reward model

using the HelpSteer dataset (sample size n = 5148). Each example in HelpSteer includes human ratings on five attributes

using a Likert-5 scale: Helpfulness, Correctness, Coherence, Complexity, and Verbosity. (Wang et al., 2023). We expect

“helpfulness” to have a positive treatment effect on reward scores.

In this synthetic experiment, we introduce a correlation between “complexity” and “helpfulness” into the evaluation dataset.

While we expect the treatment effect of “helpfulness” to be positive, we should see a constant treatment effect even under

distributional shift. In Figure 6, we can see that the naive treatment effect increases as we introduce a spurious correlation

between complexity and helpfulness into the evaluation data, while the RATE estimators remain much closer to constant.

Again, we note that the double-rewrite estimator is more stable than the single-rewrite estimator.

Figure 6. We estimate the treatment effect of a concept on a reward model under distributional shift using three estimators: naive (blue),

[

ATE(Rewrite) (green), and [

ATE(Rewrite2) (orange). We see that the causal estimators remain near constant while the naive estimator

changes as the distribution shifts. 95% confidence intervals are shown. We estimate the effect of “helpfulness” on ArmoRM scores using

the HelpSteer dataset under distribution shift. We expect the “ground truth” effect of “helpfulness” to be positive and to remain unchanged

as we add a spurious correlation between “helpfulness” and “complexity” in the evaluation data. The naive estimator (blue) shows an

increasing effect size as we increase the correlation between “complexity” and “helpfulness” while both the single- and double-rewrite

estimators (green, orange) remain near constant.

C.2. Synthetic Experiment Implementation

Our semi-synthetic experiments took data from a real-world dataset (IMDB and HelpSteer) and artificially induced a

correlation between the target attribute and the off-target attribute. As both the target and off-target attributes are binary, we

can easily control the correlation between them. We group the data into the four possible combinations of the target and

off-target attributes (e.g., long positive, short positive, long negative, short negative) and then randomly sample from these

groups to create a new dataset. We then evaluate the reward model on this new dataset to see how the correlation affects the

estimated treatment effect.

D.1. Single vs. Double-Rewrite Estimates

There are significant differences between the single-rewrite estimator and the double-rewrite estimator. Each subplot shows

the ATE, ATT, and ATU for a different reward model and attribute. Hence, using double rewrites is crucial for estimating the

true treatment effect of an attribute on a reward model.

Figure 7. Using RATE (rewrites of rewrites) rather than just rewrites changes the estimated treatment effects. Here we compare treatment

effects of complexity, using data from HelpSteer.

effects of helpfulness, using data from HelpSteer.

Length

Adjust this answer so it’s {W}, but change *nothing* else. If

the above answer is phrased as a question do not answer it. Just

rewrite the question following the same instructions.

Table 5. Example rewrite prompts from experiments with sentiment and length as the target attribute. For the ELI5 dataset, some of the

responses were phrased as questions, so we instructed our rewriter (GPT-4o) not to answer the question and instead rewrite it.

E. Example Rewrites

E.1. Iterating the Rewrite Instructions

One surprising behavior we encountered is that, when the example response in need of a rewrite was phrased as a question,

the LLM would often answer the question rather than rewriting it. Based on this, we included explicit instructions not to

answer questions but, rather, to rewrite them for the HH-RLHF dataset (see Table 5).

E.2. Ill-defined Target Attributes

In some cases, the target attribute is not well-defined. For example, in the HH-RLHF dataset, neutral questions have no clear

sentiment, and consequently the rewrites add strange syntax: “annoyingly the same size” and “frustratingly square” (see

Table 6). We qualitatively check for these cases, and only use datasets where the target attribute is consistently well-defined.

Table 6. For some text, our target attribute (W = Sentiment) is not well-defined. Rewrites add strange syntax: “annoyingly the same size”

and “frustratingly square”. Data from the HH-RLHF dataset.

The following tables show randomly 8 sampled original text and rewrites for a given dataset and attribute, with reward

From the (ELI5, Length) experiment:

Reward Question: Why does shaking our arms/legs after stretching make them feel better

Original (W = 0): We have a natural tendency to shake our limbs after a really good stretch, which is known as [stretch

reflex]( URL 0 ). When you stretch a large muscle, a special group of nerves is stimulated whose purpose is to resist the

stretch by opposing muscles to contract. When you shake your limbs you are easing that stress caused by the push-pull

action between the opposing muscle groups and that’s why you feel better.

Rewrite (W = 1): We have a natural tendency to shake our limbs after a really good stretch, which is known as the stretch

reflex (URL 0). This phenomenon occurs when you stretch a large muscle, and a special group of nerves is stimulated. The

purpose of these nerves is to resist the stretch by causing the opposing muscles to contract. This push-pull action between

opposing muscle groups can create a certain level of stress or tension within the muscles. When you shake your limbs, you

are engaging in an action that helps to ease that stress caused by the push-pull interaction between the opposing muscle

groups. This is why you tend to feel better after shaking your limbs following a good stretch.

However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master

From the (Helpsteer, Complexity) experiment:

Reward Question: Consider this reference information delimited in ”””: ””” Separation anxiety occurs in adults as well,

and can be an equally serious problem, so much so that psychologists have considered adding it to the diagnostic manual.

Many adults suffer from separation anxiety issues and either may not be aware, or fail to seek treatment. Thus, separation

anxiety in adults is likely underreported, and a much more widespread problem than originally believed to be.

Separation anxiety, when extreme, is usually pretty easy to identify. Adults who have serious separation anxiety tend to have

an unhealthy attachment to a person with whom they are close to, and experience intense anxiety and panic when having

to separate from that person. Yet, in less severe cases of separation anxiety, the signs may not be as obvious. Some less

apparent signs of ASA are:

Extreme Jealousy - adults with separation anxiety may demonstrate signs of jealousy in relationships. A fear of abandonment

is often what drives those with ASA to experience jealousy. This is especially true if the jealousy is accompanied by anxious

thoughts, such as a fear of being alone or irrational concerns about infidelity. Of course, jealousy may be completely

unrelated to ASA - for example, control of others is the cause of jealousy, as are trust issues - but some forms of deep

jealousy may also be due to separation anxiety. Over Strict Parenting - there is some evidence that extremely strict and

demanding parents may have separation anxiety issues as well. Sometimes referred to as reverse-separation anxiety, the

parents may be so concerned that their child will leave them someday that they try to control the child’s life as much

as possible. Stuck in Relationships - another way separation anxiety may manifest itself is in the way adults treat their

relationships. Whether romantic, familial, or friend relationships, but also friendships and occasionally familial relationships,

many with ASA work to maintain the relationship even when extremely unhealthy (emotionally, physically), out of fear of

being alone. Mooching - those that ”mooch” off their parents well into adulthood, or those that never seem to leave their

friends’ homes may be experiencing separation anxiety in some way. Because there are currently no diagnostic criteria for

ASA, the discussion of ways it manifests is purely speculative. Regardless, adult separation anxiety is a genuine problem,

and affects the lives of countless adults. ”””

Does the author use a biased tone of voice in the provided passage? Please explain your answer in at least one paragraph of

100 words or more in length. I want to make sure that the tone is objective and unprejudiced before presenting it to my

collaborative group.

Original (W = 0): No, the author does not use a biased tone of voice in the provided passage. The author presents

information about separation anxiety in adults in a neutral and objective manner. The language used is factual and does not

contain any personal opinions or judgments. The passage also does not show any favoritism towards or prejudice against

any particular group of people who may suffer from separation anxiety. Overall, the tone of the passage is consistent with

the purpose of providing information about a psychological condition rather than advocating for or against any particular

viewpoint.

tone of the passage aligns seamlessly with the objective of disseminating information about a psychological condition, rather

than endorsing or opposing any particular perspective.

Rewrite of Rewrite: The author avoids using a biased tone in the passage. They clearly present information about separation

anxiety in adults in a neutral and objective way. The language is factual and free of personal opinions or subjective judgments.
