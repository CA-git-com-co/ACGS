Abstract

Recent few-shot methods, such as parameter-

efﬁcient ﬁne-tuning (PEFT) and pattern ex-

ploiting training (PET), have achieved impres-

sive results in label-scarce settings.

How-

ever, they are difﬁcult to employ since they

are subject to high variability from manually

crafted prompts, and typically require billion-

parameter language models to achieve high ac-

curacy.

To address these shortcomings, we

propose SETFIT (Sentence Transformer Fine-

tuning), an efﬁcient and prompt-free frame-

work for few-shot ﬁne-tuning of Sentence

Transformers (ST). SETFIT works by ﬁrst ﬁne-

tuning a pretrained ST on a small number of

text pairs, in a contrastive Siamese manner.

The resulting model is then used to generate

rich text embeddings, which are used to train a

classiﬁcation head. This simple framework re-

quires no prompts or verbalizers, and achieves

high accuracy with orders of magnitude less

parameters than existing techniques. Our ex-

periments show that SETFIT obtains compa-

rable results with PEFT and PET techniques,

while being an order of magnitude faster to

train. We also show that SETFIT can be ap-

plied in multilingual settings by simply switch-

ing the ST body. Our code1 and datasets2 are

made publicly available.

Introduction

Few-shot learning methods have emerged as an at-

tractive solution to label-scarce scenarios, where

data annotation can be time-consuming and costly.

These methods are designed to work with a small

number of labeled training examples, and typi-

cally involve adapting pretrained language models

(PLMs) for speciﬁc downstream tasks.

Today, there exist several approaches to few-

shot learning with PLMs.

These include in-

context learning (ICL), parameter-efﬁcient ﬁne-

tuning (PEFT), and pattern exploiting training

more sample efﬁcient and exhibits less variability when

trained on a small number of labeled examples.

(PET). Unfortunately, these approaches can be im-

practical for many researchers and practitioners.

One disadvantage is that these approaches typically

rely on the use of large-scale language models to

achieve high performance. For example, T-FEW

(Liu et al., 2022) is based on the 11 billion param-

eter model T0 (Sanh et al., 2021), while GPT-3

(Brown et al., 2020a) is an order of magnitude

larger. Secondly, training and deploying these few-

shot methods typically requires specialized infras-

tructure with limited accessibility. Moreover, PET

and the prominent PEFT methods require, as part

of their training, the input of manually generated

prompts, yielding varying outcomes depending on

the level of manual prompt-engineering.

In this paper, we propose SETFIT, an approach

based on Sentence Transformers (ST) (Reimers

and Gurevych, 2019) that dispenses with prompts

altogether and does not require large-scale PLMs

to achieve high accuracy. For example, with only

8 labeled examples in the Customer Reviews (CR)

sentiment dataset, SETFIT is competitive with ﬁne-

tuning on the full training set, despite the ﬁne-tuned

model being three times larger (see Figure 1).

We demonstrate SETFIT’s efﬁcacy in few-shot

text classiﬁcation over a range of NLP datasets

and in multiple scenarios including distillation and

non-English data. We compare our method to stan-

dard PLM ﬁne-tuning, state-of-the-art PET- and

PEFT-based methods such as ADAPET (Tam et al.,

2021) and T-FEW (Liu et al., 2022), as well as

recent prompt-free techniques such as PERFECT

(Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2022a).

We summarize our contributions as follows:

1. We propose SETFIT– a simple and prompt-

free method – and provide a comprehensive

guide for applying it in practical few-shot set-

tings.

2. We evaluate SETFIT’s performance on a num-

ber of few-shot text classiﬁcations tasks and

show that it outperforms the state-of-the-

art prompt-free method and ranks alongside

much larger prompt-based, few-shot models.

3. We make the code and data used in our work

publicly available.

Related Work

SETFIT engages with two related lines of literature.

We ﬁrst extend the small but signiﬁcant body of

work on Sentence Transformers (ST) for text classi-

ﬁcation. Perone et al. (2018) introduced the idea of

using sentence embeddings for text classiﬁcation.

Piao (2021) used ’out-of-the-box’ STs for text clas-

siﬁcation without ﬁne-tuning them. SETFIT differs

from these works in two aspects: First, we ﬁne-tune

the ST in a Siamese manner for a text classiﬁcation

objective showing that it signiﬁcantly enhances per-

formance; second, we demonstrate this approach

in few-shot setups.

SETFIT is also related to the recently emerging

few-shot and zero-shot training line of literature as

few-shot and zero-shot approaches have recently

received a great deal of interest in the research

community due to the availability of pretrained lan-

guage models and the untapped capacity to use

them in resource-constrained domains. Speciﬁ-

cally, we discuss ICL, PEFT, and prompt-based

ﬁne-tuning.

ICL models directly generate predictions based

on input-to-output training examples provided as

prompts, without any parameter updates. Perhaps

the best known example is GPT-3 (Brown et al.,

2020b), which achieves remarkable few-shot per-

formance. However, GPT-3 contains 175 billion

parameters and requires massive computational re-

sources, prompt engineering, and can only utilize

pretrained knowledge.

PEFT methods, such as adapters (Rebufﬁet al.,

2017), hold the majority of parameters ﬁxed dur-

ing training and only update small feed-forward

networks that are inserted within the larger model

architecture. A recent example is T-FEW (Liu et al.,

2022), which outperforms GPT-3 at much lower

computational cost. It accomplishes this by adding

learned vectors that rescale the network’s internal

activations. T-FEW is 16 times smaller than GPT-3,

but is still too large to be utilized as a practical tool

in industry. It also requires a set of handcrafted

prompts for each dataset.

Another alternative to ICL is prompt-based ﬁne-

tuning. This approach converts the downstream

classiﬁcation task into a masked-language model-

ing (MLM) objective. The model outputs tokens in

a cloze-style format that maps to the corresponding

labels via a predeﬁned template. A well known ex-

ample of this method is Pattern Exploiting Training

(PET) (Schick and Schütze, 2021b,a) . Like GPT-

3, PET relies on manually-crafted prompts, but

since the model can be ﬁne-tuned to speciﬁc tasks,

PET-based approaches typically outperform GPT-3

in few-shot scenarios, even with far smaller PLM

backbones. PET has since been extended in two

main directions: ADAPET (Tam et al., 2021), which

improves PET with a decoupled label objective

and label-conditioned MLM objective, and PER-

FECT (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2022b) which uses

task-speciﬁc adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeif-

fer et al., 2021) and multi-token label-embeddings

eliminate task prompts and verbalizers.

SetFit: Sentence Transformer

Fine-Tuning

SETFIT is based on Sentence Transformers

(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) which are modi-

ﬁcations of pretrained transformer models that use

Siamese and triplet network structures to derive se-

mantically meaningful sentence embeddings. The

goal of these models is to minimize the distance be-

tween pairs of semantically similar sentences and

maximize the distance between sentence pairs that

are semantically distant. Standard STs output a

ﬁxed, dense vector that is meant to represent tex-

tual data and can then be used by machine learning

algorithms.

## Page 3

Figure 2: SETFIT ’s ﬁne-tuning and training block diagram.

3.1

The SETFIT approach for few-shot text

classiﬁcation

SETFIT uses a two-step training approach in which

we ﬁrst ﬁne-tune an ST and then train a classiﬁer

head. In the ﬁrst step, an ST is ﬁne-tuned on the

input data in a contrastive, Siamese manner on

sentence pairs. In the second step, a text classiﬁca-

tion head is trained using the encoded training data

generated by the ﬁne-tuned ST from the ﬁrst step.

Figure 2 illustrates this process, and we discuss

these two steps in the following sections.

ST ﬁne-tuning

To better handle the limited

amount of labeled training data in few-shot scenar-

ios, we adopt a contrastive training approach that is

often used for image similarity (Koch et al., 2015).

Formally, given a small set of K labeled examples

D = {(xi, yi)}, where xi and yi are sentences and

their class labels, respectively. For each class la-

bel c ∈C, we generate a set of R positive triplets

T c

p = {(xi, xj, 1)}, where xi and xj are pairs of

randomly chosen sentences from the same class c

such that (yi = yj = c). Similarly, we also gener-

ate a set of R negative triplets T c

n = {(xi, xj, 0)},

where xi are sentences from class c and xj are ran-

domly chosen sentences from different classes such

that (yi = c, yj ̸= c). Finally, the contrastive ﬁne

tuning data set T is produced by concatenating the

positive and negative triplets across all class labels;

## T = {(T 0

p , T 0

n), (T 1

p , T 1

n), ..., (T |C|

p

## , T |C|

n )}, where

|C| is the number of class labels, |T| = 2R|C| is

the number of pairs in T and R is a hyperparameter.

Unless stated otherwise, we used R = 20 in all the

evaluations.

This contrastive ﬁne-tuning approach enlarges

the size of training data in few-shot scenarios. As-

suming that a small number (K) of labeled exam-

ples are given for a binary classiﬁcation task, the

potential size of the ST ﬁne-tuning set T is derived

from the number of unique sentence pairs that can

be generated, namely K(K −1)/2, which is sig-

niﬁcantly larger than just K.

Classiﬁcation head training

In this second step,

the ﬁne-tuned ST encodes the original labeled train-

ing data {xi}, yielding a single sentence embed-

ding per training sample; Embxi = ST(xi) where

ST() is the function representing the ﬁne-tuned

ST. The embeddings, along with their class labels,

constitute the training set for the classiﬁcation head

T CH = {(Embxi, yi)} where |T CH| = |D|. A

logistic regression model is used as the text classi-

ﬁcation head throughout this work.

Inference

At inference time, the ﬁne-tuned ST

encodes an unseen input sentence (xi) and pro-

duces a sentence embedding. Next, the classiﬁ-

cation head that was trained in the training step,

produces the class prediction of the input sentence

based on its sentence embedding. Formally this is

xpred

i

= CH(ST(xi)), where CH represents the

classiﬁcation head prediction function.

Experiments

4.1

Data

We conduct experiments on available text classiﬁ-

cation datasets. We split the datasets into develop-

ment and test datasets (See Table 6 in Appendix

A). The development datasets are utilized for set-

ting SETFIT’s hyperparameters such as the number

of training pairs (|T|), the loss function and the

optimal number of training epochs. In order to

test the robustness of SETFIT to various types of

text, we choose test datasets that represent different

text classiﬁcation tasks with a varying number of

classes. All datasets used are available on the Hug-

ging Face Hub under the SETFIT organisation.3 In

addition we evaluate SETFIT on the RAFT bench-

mark (Alex et al., 2021), a real-world few-shot

text-classiﬁcation benchmark composed of 11 prac-

tical tasks, where each task has only 50 training

Baselines

We compare SETFIT’s performance against stan-

dard transformer ﬁne-tuning and recent best-

performing few-shot approaches: ADAPET (Tam

et al., 2021), PERFECT (Karimi Mahabadi et al.,

2022b), and T-FEW (Liu et al., 2022).

Standard ﬁne-tuning

Our ﬁrst baseline is

ROBERTALARGE (Liu et al., 2019), a standard,

encoder-only transformer that is ﬁne-tuned for se-

quence classiﬁcation. Since we assume no val-

idation sets, we constructed validation splits by

randomly selecting equally sized portions from the

train split. We perform a hyperparameter search on

the number of epochs in the range [25,75] and pick

the best performing model on a validation split.

We use a learning rate of 2e−5 and batch size of

4 in all our experiments.

## Adapet

Pattern

exploiting

training

## (Pet)

(Schick and Schütze, 2021b,a) is a method for

improving PLM performance in few-shot setups on

downstream tasks by converting textual input into

a cloze-style question intended to be reminiscent of

the masked language modelling (MLM) objective

under which large PLMs such as BERT (Devlin

et al., 2019) are trained. To determine SETFIT’s

performance relative to PET-based approaches,

we compare our method to ADAPET (Tam et al.,

2021), an extension of PET. In recent work

co/sentence-transformers/

paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2

6https://huggingface.

co/sentence-transformers/

paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2

(Schick and Schütze, 2021), the authors show that

PET-based classiﬁcation methods excel on the

RAFT benchmark, placing second only to much

larger models such as T-FEW. In our experiments,

we used ADAPET with default hyperparameters

and examined its performance with different PLM

backbones, reporting the PLM which resulted in

the best performance, albert-xxlarge-v2 7 (see

Appendix A.2 in the Appendix for further details).

## Perfect

PERFECT (Karimi Mahabadi et al.,

2022b) is another cloze-based ﬁne-tuning method,

but unlike PET or ADAPET, it does not require

handcrafted task prompts and verbalizers. Instead,

PERFECT uses task-speciﬁc adapters (Houlsby

et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021) and multi-token

label-embeddings which are independent from the

language model vocabulary during ﬁne-tuning. To

run PERFECT on our test datasets, we adapted the

conﬁgurations provided in the PERFECT codebase.

## T-Few

T-FEW (Liu et al., 2022) is a PEFT-based

few-shot learning method based on T0 (Sanh et al.,

2021). The authors provide two versions of T-FEW:

11 and 3 billion parameters. Due to compute con-

straints, we were unable to run the 11 billion ver-

sion, which requires an 80GB A100 GPU. Running

tests on T-FEW as opposed to SETFIT posed sev-

eral hurdles. First, because T-FEW’s performance

varies signiﬁcantly depending on the input prompts,

we run each experiment using 5 random seeds, and

report the median result, as in the original paper.

Second, T-FEW relies on dataset-speciﬁc prompts,

made available on P3 (Public Pool of Prompts)

(Bach et al., 2022). Only one of our test datasets

had prompts in P3. For the rest of the datasets, we

adapt standardized P3 prompts of similar tasks or

implement prompts ourselves (See Appendix A.3).

4.4

Experimental Setup

Systematically evaluating few-shot performance

can be challenging, because ﬁne-tuning on small

datasets may incur instability (Dodge et al., 2020;

Zhang et al., 2021). To address this issue, in our

experiments we use 10 random training splits for

each dataset and sample size. These splits are used

as training data across all tested methods. For each

method, we report the average measure (depending

on the dataset) and the standard deviation across

these splits. We ﬁne-tune SETFIT’s ST model using

Results

Table

shows

a

comparison

between

SETFITMPNET and the baselines for N

=

8

and N = 64 labeled training samples per class.

For reference purposes, standard ﬁne-tuning results

using the full training data are also shown (in all

cases higher scores indicates stronger performance;

see Table 6 in Appendix A for dataset metric

details). We ﬁnd that SETFITMPNET signiﬁcantly

outperforms the FINETUNE baseline for N = 8 by

an average of 19.3 points. However, as the number

of training samples increases to N = 64, the gap

decreases to 5.6 points.

Similarly, we ﬁnd that SETFITMPNET out-

performs PERFECT by 13.6 and 2.6 points.

SETFITMPNET also outperforms ADAPET by 4.0

and 1.5 points for N = 8 and N = 64 respec-

tively. For N = 8, SETFITMPNET is on par with

T-FEW 3B whereas for N = 64 SETFITMPNET out-

performs T-FEW 3B by 5 points on average, despite

being prompt-free and more than 27 times smaller.

RAFT results

The test datasets listed in Table 2

were not speciﬁcally designed for few-shot bench-

marking. In order to better benchmark SETFIT,

we used the RAFT benchmark (Alex et al., 2021)

which is speciﬁcally designed for benchmarking

few-shot methods. Table 3 shows the average ac-

curacy of SETFITMPNET and SETFITROBERTA and

four prominent methods. SETFITROBERTA outper-

forms GPT3 and PET by 8.6 and 1.7 points respec-

tively while alleviating the need for hand crafting

prompts. It also surpasses the human baseline in

7 out of 11 tasks. SETFITROBERTA falls short of T-

FEW 11B by 4.5 points. however, SETFITROBERTA

is more than 30 times smaller than T-FEW 11B,

does not require manual prompt crafting and is

much more efﬁcient in training and inference (see

Table 5).

6

Multilingual Experiments

To determine SETFIT’s performance in a multi-

lingual, few-shot text classiﬁcation scenario, we

conducted development and test experiments on

multilingual datasets and compared SETFIT to stan-

dard transformer ﬁne-tuning and ADAPET. To the

best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to ex-

amine ADAPET on non-English data (see Appendix

A for details).

Experimental Setup

For the multilingual exper-

iments, we use the Multilingual Amazon Reviews

Corpus (MARC) (Keung et al., 2020). This dataset

consists of Amazon reviews in six languages (En-

glish, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, and Chi-

nese), where each review is labeled according to

a 5-star rating scale. We chose this corpus for its

typological diversity in order to examine the gener-

alizability of SETFIT and other methods across a

variety of languages.

For the SETFIT underlying model, we use

paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2,8 which is

a multilingual version of paraphrase-mpnet-base-

v2 that is trained on parallel data in over 50 lan-

guages.

For the FINETUNE and ADAPET baselines, we

use XLM-ROBERTABASE (Conneau et al., 2019),9

which has a similar size to the SETFIT model. We

compare the performance of each method using the

same settings as (Conneau et al., 2019):

• each: Train and evaluate on monolingual data

to measure per-language performance.

• en: Train on the English training data and

then evaluate on each language’s test set.

• all: Train on all the training data and evaluate

on each language’s test set.

Method

For SETFIT standard ﬁne-tuning, and

ADAPET, we adopt the same methodology and hy-

perparameters used for the monolingual English

experiments in 4. We evaluate each method in the

few-shot regime (N = 8 samples per class) and

compare against performance of ﬁne-tuning on the

full training set of 20,000 examples.

Results

Table 4 shows the results of SETFIT

standard ﬁne-tuning, and ADAPET on each lan-

guage in MARC, where a higher MAE indicates

weaker performance. In the few-shot regime of

N = 8 samples per class, we ﬁnd that SETFIT

signiﬁcantly outperforms FINETUNE and ADAPET

in all settings (each, en, all), with the best average

performance obtained when training on English

data only.

SETFIT Model Efﬁciency

7.1

Few-shot distillation

We have shown that SETFIT achieves state-of-the-

art results in few-shot setups using underlying

base models such as paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2 and

ROBERTALARGE, containing 110M parameters and

355M parameters respectively; but in real-world

deployments, where cost and sustainability are pri-

oritized, the use on even more efﬁcient models is

desirable. Previous works have shown model dis-

tillation to be effective in reducing computational

load while preserving much of the original model’s

performance (Ba and Caruana, 2014; Hinton et al.,

2015). In this section we evaluate the performance

of SETFIT as a student model compared to a stan-

dard transformer student model in few-shot distilla-

tion setups when the amount of unlabeled training

data is limited.

Experimental Setup

For the distillation tests we

use the datasets AGNews, Emotion and SST-5 de-

scribed in Appendix A.1. For the SETFIT teacher

we chose SETFITMPNET, which contains 110M pa-

rameters, whereas for the SETFIT student we chose

SETFITMINILM, which is a much smaller model

(15M parameters). For fair comparison, we use as

the baseline student MiniLM-L3-H384-uncased10,

a standard transformer encoder of the same size

as our SETFIT student model. For each of the

three datasets we train the SETFIT teacher model

using only 16 labeled samples per class, and the stu-

dent models are trained using the same 16 labeled

samples per class together with various amounts

of additional unlabeled data. We follow the same

data-split policy and SETFIT training parameters’

settings described in Section 4.4.

Method

The SETFIT student is trained using sen-

tence pairs and the level of similarity between each

pair as input. The similarity is generated by using

the underlying ST of the teacher to produce sen-

tence embeddings for each pair and to calculate the

cosine-similarity between them. The underlying ST

of the SETFIT student is trained to mimic the ST of

the teacher output by minimizing the error between

the SETFIT teacher-produced cosine-similarity and

its output. The classiﬁcation head of the student

is then trained using the embeddings produced by

the student’s ST and the logits produced by the

SETFIT teacher classiﬁcation head. The baseline

student is trained to mimic the teacher output by

minimizing the error between the logits produced

by the SETFIT teacher classiﬁcation head and its

output.

Results

Figure 3 shows a comparison between

the SETFIT student model and the baseline stu-

dent model for various amounts of unlabeled train-

ing data (N). The SETFIT student signiﬁcantly

outperforms the baseline student when only small

amounts of unlabeled data are available. For exam-

ple, for N = 8, the SETFIT student outperforms

the baseline student by 24.8, 25.1, and 8.9 aver-

age accuracy on the AGNews, Emotion and SST5

datasets, respectively. As N increases, the perfor-

mance gains decrease and are on par for N = 1K.

Computational costs

Comparing the relative computational costs of SET-

FIT versus PET and PEFT methods isn’t straight-

forward since each method typically has different

hardware and memory requirements.

To simplify the comparison, we follow the ap-

proach adopted by Liu et al. (2022) and use FLOPs-

per-token estimates to compare SETFIT to T-FEW.

These estimates can be obtained from Kaplan et al.

## Page 8

(2020), who show that encoder-only models with

N parameters have approximately 2N FLOPs-per-

token for inference and 6N FLOPs-per-token for

training. The resulting cost for inference and train-

ing is then given by:

Cinf = 2N · ℓseq ,

Ctrain = 6N · ℓseq · nsteps · nbatch ,

where ℓseq is the input sequence length, nsteps

is the number of training steps, and nbatch is the

batch size. For encoder-decoder models like T-

FEW, these estimates are halved, since the model

only processes each token with either the encoder

or decoder.

For the inference and training estimates shown

in Table 5, we use ℓseq = 38 and ℓseq = 54 as the

input sequence length for SETFITMPNET (T-FEW);

this is the median number of tokens across all the

test datasets in Table 2. We also use nsteps = 1000

and nbatch = 8 for all training estimates. As shown

in the table, the SETFITMPNET model is approxi-

mately an order of magnitude faster at inference

and training than T-FEW, despite having compa-

rable performance on the test datasets of Table 2.

SETFITMINILM is two orders of magnitude faster

than T-FEW, with an average score reduction of 3.1

accuracy points. Moreover, the storage cost of the

SETFIT models (70MB and 420MB respectively) is

163 to 26 times smaller than the T0-3B checkpoint

used by T-FEW 3B (11.4GB), making these models

much better suited for real-world deployment.

These estimates are borne out by comparing

the time needed to train each method to conver-

gence on N = 8 examples.

For our datasets,

SETFITMPNET takes approximately 30 seconds to

train on a p3.2xlarge AWS instance (16GB GPU

memory), at a cost of $0.025 per split. On the other

hand, T-FEW 3B requires at least 40GB GPU mem-

ory, and training on a p4d.24xlarge AWS instance

takes approximately 700 seconds, at a cost of $0.7

per split.

Conclusion

This paper introduces SETFIT, a new few-shot text

classiﬁcation approach. We show that SETFIT has

several advantages over comparable approaches

such as T-FEW, ADAPET and PERFECT. In particu-

lar, SETFIT is much faster at inference and training;

SETFIT requires much smaller base models to be

performant, not requiring external compute; and

Relative computational cost and average

test datasets listed in Table 2. †Trained in the distilla-

tion setup as described in Section 7.1, using |N| = 8

for teacher training and the rest of the available training

data as unlabeled student training data. For ﬁxed nsteps

and nbatch, the relative speed-up (N ′ ·ℓ′

seq)/(2N ·ℓseq)

is the same for inference and training.

SETFIT is additionally not subject to the instabil-

ity and inconvenience of prompting. We have also

demonstrated that SETFIT is a robust few-shot text

classiﬁer in languages other than English across

varying typologies. Finally, SETFIT has proven

useful in few-shot distillation setups.

Datasets

Table 6 shows the development and test datasets

that are used for setting SETFIT’s hyperparameters.

Following is a description of the datasets used:

## Sst2

The Stanford Sentiment Treebank 2 is a

collection of single sentence movie reviews with

positive-negative sentiment class labels. (Socher

et al., 2013).

## Imdb

The Internet Movie Database dataset is

a collection of single sentence movie reviews with

positive-negative sentiment class labels. (Maas

BBC News

The BBC News dataset is a collec-

tion of articles from the news outlet BBC with one

of 5 topic classiﬁcations: Politics, Sports, Enter-

tainment, Tech, and Business. (Greene and Cun-

ningham, 2006).

Enron Spam

The Enron spam email dataset

consists of emails from the internal Enron corre-

spondence channel where emails are classiﬁed as

spam or not spam. (V. Metsis and Paliouras, 2006).

Student Question Categories11

This is a set

of questions from university entrance exams in In-

dia that are classiﬁed into 4 subjects: Math, Biol-

ogy, Chemistry, Physics.

Treebank-5

## (Sst5)

The SST-5 dataset is the ﬁne-grained version of the

Stanford Sentiment Treebank, where each example

is given one of ﬁve labels: very positive, positive,

neutral, negative, very negative.

Amazon Counterfactual

The Amazon Coun-

terfactual dataset is set of Amazon customer re-

views with professionally labeled binary labels

of counterfactual detection. Counterfactual state-

ments are statements that denote something that

did not happen or cannot (e.g. "They are much

bigger than I thought they would be."). We used

the English subset for our experiments. (O’Neill

et al., 2021).

Customer Reviews

The Customer Reviews

(Hu and Liu, 2004) dataset is part of the of Sen-

tEval (Conneau and Kiela, 2018) benchmark. It is

composed of positive and negative opinions mined

from the web and written by customers about a

variety of products.

Emotion14

The Emotion dataset consists of

tweets from Twitter that display clear emotions

(e.g. "i am now nearly ﬁnished [with] the week

detox and i feel amazing"). Labels are one of six

categories: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and sur-

prise. (Saravia et al., 2018).

AG News

AG News is a dataset of news titles

from AG news with one of 4 classiﬁcations (World,

Entertainment, Sports, and Business). (Zhang et al.,

2015b).

ADAPET Training Procedure

By default, ADAPET assumes access to a training,

development, and test dataset. It trains for 1, 000

batches, runs predictions on the development data

every 250 batches and checkpoints, keeping the

model state which performed best on the devel-

opment dataset. In our case, where we assume

few-shot training and no development data, we

ran ADAPET for 1, 000 batches and disabled the

checkpointing, using the model state that resulted

after training for 1, 000 batches. For the English

data in Table 2, we used the pattern "[TEXT1]

this is [LBL]", where "[TEXT1]" and "[LBL]" are

placeholders for a given piece of text and the cor-

responding label, respectively. We constructed the

labels to a star rating, for example, 0 = 1 star

and 4 = 5 stars, again asking native speakers of

each language to translate the verbalizer into their

language.

## A.3

Prompts used in T-FEW

The Emotion dataset is the only one that had ex-

isting prompts in P3 (Public Pool of Prompts)

(Bach et al., 2022). For three other datasets, we

had to adapt existing prompts designed for simi-

lar datasets on P3, by making minimal required

changes to address the differences in data domains

or label names:

• Prompts for Enron Spam,

a spam e-

mail detection dataset, were adapted from

sms_spam dataset prompts.

## • Cr

prompts

were

adapted

from

amazon_polarity.

## • Sst5

prompts

were

adapted

from

yelp_review_full.

The Amazon Counterfactual dataset does not

have any relevant prompts on P3. Hence, we man-

ually generated prompts ourselves, based on stan-

dard practices for prompt creation published in P3.

We also added two new prompts for SST5, to make

it compatible with the label names of SST5. Fol-

lowing is a list of prompts we created for each

dataset:
