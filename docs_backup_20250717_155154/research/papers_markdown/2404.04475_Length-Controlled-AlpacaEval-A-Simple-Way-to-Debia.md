Abstract

LLM-based auto-annotators have become a key component of the LLM de-

velopment process due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared

to human-based evaluation. However, these auto-annotators can introduce

biases that are hard to remove. Even simple, known confounders such

as preference for longer outputs remain in existing automated evaluation

metrics. We propose a simple regression analysis approach for controlling

biases in auto-evaluations. As a real case study, we focus on reducing the

length bias of AlpacaEval, a fast and affordable benchmark for instruction-

tuned LLMs that uses LLMs to estimate response quality. Despite being

highly correlated with human preferences, AlpacaEval is known to favor

models that generate longer outputs. We introduce a length-controlled

AlpacaEval that aims to answer the counterfactual question: "What would

the preference be if the model’s and baseline’s output had the same

length?" To achieve this, we first fit a generalized linear model to predict

the biased auto-annotator’s preferences based on the mediators we want to

control for (length difference) and other relevant features. We then obtain

length-controlled preferences by predicting preferences while conditioning

the GLM with a zero difference in lengths. Length-controlling not only

improves the robustness of the metric to manipulations in model verbosity,

we also find that it increases the Spearman correlation with LMSYS Chatbot

Arena from 0.94 to 0.98. We release the code and resulting leaderboard.

Introduction

Figure 1: AlpacaEval length-controlled increases correlation with the LMSYS Chatbot Arena

from 0.94 to 0.98. It is currently the automatic benchmark with the highest correlation with

Chatbot Arena.

Developing and improving NLP systems requires reliable, low-cost evaluations that can

quantify progress. In closed-ended tasks, such as multiple-choice QA, such evaluations are

straightforward to implement and trust (Novikova et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2021). However,

such evaluations cannot be applied to open-ended settings such as instruction following

for language models. Even neural reference-based evaluation metrics such as BERTscore

(Zhang* et al., 2020) face challenges in those settings due to the difficulty of collecting a

diverse set of references that can cover the space of valid outputs.

Recently, there has been a push toward reference-free evaluation methods that leverage

high-performance LLMs, e.g. AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), MTBench (Zheng et al., 2023), and

WildBench (Lin et al., 2024). While these approaches show a high correlation with human

annotators, they often do so by exploiting spurious correlations such as the length of the

output, the presence of lists, or various position biases Li et al. (2023); Zheng et al. (2023);

Koo et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023); Wu & Aji (2023).

Creating a way to debias automated evaluation metrics would be highly valuable – it would

address the major drawback of LLM-based reference-free evaluations and enable low-cost,

accurate evaluations for developing NLP systems in open-ended settings. Our work focuses

on this challenge of taking an existing automated evaluation metric (e.g. AlpacaEval) and a

suspected spurious correlate (e.g. length) and producing a debiased metric.

We propose a simple, interpretable debiasing strategy for automated evaluation metrics

based on basic, regression-based adjustments for observational causal inference. We view

spurious correlates – such as the length of the response – as undesirable mediators Vander-

Weele (2015) in a causal graph and use regression-based causal inference Hernán & Robins

(2010) techniques to provide simple adjustments to automated evaluations that control for

any suspected spurious variables.

Applying this approach to the popular AlpacaEval benchmark, we show that controlling

for length positively affects automated evaluation. We find that it is more correlated on

average with the LMSYS Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023) than both (length-uncontrolled)

AlpacaEval and MT-bench, and that it is significantly more robust to gaming the evaluation

by increasing the verbosity of the output.

Our contributions are the following:

• We propose a simple regression-based approach to debias automated metrics, while

maintaining desirable properties.

• We apply the approach to AlpacaEval, producing AlpacaEval-LC, which is more robust

to length-based spurious correlates.

• We show that AlpacaEval-LC correlates better with the human evaluations of model

rankings (Chatbot Arena) Fig. 1.

Background and Problem Setting

Our work relates to both the classic literature on reference-free evaluations, as well as more

recent developments in automated and human evaluation of chatbots. We describe some of

these relevant works below, with some additional exposition on the details of AlpacaEval,

which we study more closely in our debiasing experiments.

Reference-free evaluation metrics.

Reference-free evaluation metrics, which aim to evalu-

ate models on open-ended tasks without using any reference answer on that task, have a

long history, including classic methods (Louis & Nenkova, 2013) and more recent neural

supervised learning methods (Kryscinski et al., 2020; Sinha et al., 2020; Goyal & Durrett,

2020). While this latter class of algorithms has become sufficiently accurate that they match

inter-annotator agreement rates, other works have shown that such measurements are heav-

ily confounded by spurious correlations such as perplexity and length (Durmus et al., 2022).

Recently, there has been a push to leverage LLMs as a zero-shot, reference-free evaluation

measure (Zheng et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024). In the chat

setting, two well-known such benchmarks are AlpacaEval and MT-bench, both of which

query an LM (based on GPT-4) to assess the quality of a weaker LM’s output.

AlpacaEval.

AlpacaEval is an LLM-based automated evaluation metric – it operates on a

fixed set of 805 instructions chosen to be representative of user interactions on the Alpaca

web demo (Taori et al., 2023). For each instruction, both a baseline model b (currently GPT-4

turbo) and the evaluated model m produce responses. A GPT-4 turbo-based evaluator

then compares the responses head-to-head and outputs the probability of preferring the

2

## Page 3

evaluated model. A win rate is then computed as the expected probability that the auto-

evaluator prefers the evaluated model’s output on the 805 instructions. This win rate serves

as a performance measure of the evaluated LM chatbot.

Originally, AlpacaEval was designed as a development metric for the Alpaca instruction-

following model (Taori et al., 2023) and AlpacaFarm simulator (Dubois et al., 2023). The

metric was designed to control for certain biases, such as the order in which the model and

baseline were presented, by randomizing their sequence. However, other factors like length

and style effects were not controlled for, as the authors found that humans had similar

biases on the analyzed data. Subsequent use of AlpacaEval as a leaderboard revealed that

these uncontrolled biases could be significantly gamed by AI systems in ways that human

biases would likely not have.

Important to our work is that AlpacaEval has several interpretable properties. As a win rate,

its values are in [0%, 100%], it has a symmetry to baseline swaps, i.e, AlpacaEval(b, m) =

100% −AlpacaEval(m, b), i.e., and comparing a baseline to itself is AlpacaEval(b, b) = 50%

Any post-hoc correction to AlpacaEval should maintain these properties, alongside the

usual desiderata of being low-cost, accurate, and robustness.

Chatbot Arena.

The automated approach to pairwise evaluation in AlpacaEval can be

viewed as a low-cost approximation to the Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023), which aims

to build real-world human evaluations through live interactions. The approach in Chatbot

Arena is that users are presented with a pair of anonymized LMs, and they can send an

instruction to both LMs simultaneously. The user receives responses from both LMs and

rates the response that is of higher quality. In the end, the head-to-head comparisons are

converted to Elo ratings (Elo, 1978) which serve as model scores. The difference in Elo

ratings between two players can be converted to a win rate, and vice versa (Elo, 1978).

This approach has many desirable properties – it is driven by real users and the dynamic

nature of the instructions makes it hard to saturate this benchmark. However, this metric can-

not be used for model development due to the cost of running many live human evaluations.

In the remainder of this work, we will treat the Chatbot Arena as a silver standard, which we

wish to approximate. Although Chatbot Arena likely still contains biases (e.g. internet users

may focus on surface features rather than “hard to measure” capabilities such as factuality),

it represents the largest publicly available human evaluation process today.

Setup.

We define the problem of pairwise evaluation of a language model in the following

way. Given an instruction x sampled from a distribution p(x), a baseline model generates

a response zb and the evaluated model generates a response zm. A human annotator then

produces a preference y ∈{0, 1} indicating whether the candidate response zm (y = 1) is

better than the baseline response zb (y = 0). An automated surrogate such as AlpacaEval is a

(potentially randomized) predictor f (zm, zb, x) that aims to approximate the corresponding

human label p(y|zm, zb, x). AlpacaEval’s current metric is the win rate winrate(m, b) of

the candidate model m over the baseline b. I.e., the expected predicted preference of

human annotators for the model response over the baseline’s response winrate(m, b) =

100 · Ex[ f (zm, zb, x)].

3

Length-Controlled AlpacaEval

A major challenge in estimating preferences f (zm, zb, x) is the spurious correlations problem.

Specifically, consider a simple example in which there is a spurious correlate c (e.g. length)

such that heavily relying upon c can be predictive of the human preferences y between

the model’s and baseline’s output. The confounder c is initially predictive of y but could

become less predictive as model builders explicitly begin to optimize against the metric.

Adopting this causal view, we ask our motivating question:

What would the AlpacaEval win rate be, if the outputs of the evaluated

model m had the same length as those of the baseline b?

3

## Page 4

Our goal in this section will be to operationalize this into a simple regression-based estimator.

To be precise, we hypothesize that automated evaluation measures f such as AlpacaEval

return their quality estimates through a combination of direct effects that measure the quality

of the model response and indirect effects that are mediated by spurious variables such as

the length of outputs. The goal of controlling for the spurious correlates is thus equivalent

to controlling these indirect effects. See Fig. 2 for a visual representation.

Figure 2: Length-Controlled AlpacaEval predicts the direct effect of the model (blue) on the

auto-annotators’ preference (white) when controlling for undesirable mediators (orange)

and other useful features (gray).

This abstraction leads us to a simple approach for bias correction, inspired by methods

for estimating Controlled Direct Effect (VanderWeele, 2010), for which simple Generalized

Linear Models (GLMs) can provide reasonable estimates.

Length control via regression.

Our approach will be to estimate the contribution of 3

different components to the AlpacaEval quality judgment:

• Model identity Whether an output comes from the baseline model b or the evaluated

model m should impact the probability that an output wins the pairwise comparison.

• Length of output The length of output is known to affect both human and model judg-

ments of output quality (Dubois et al., 2023; Singhal et al., 2023), and so we expect this to

also affect the win probability.

• Instruction difficulty Models do not perform uniformly over instructions: the preference

of humans will generally depend on the instruction. For example, the baseline might be

much better for coding tasks than any other tasks. For every instruction we thus want

to model the difficulty of that task for the baseline. Note that the (baseline) “instruction

difficulty” is not caused by “model” but conditioning on it can enhance the precision of

estimates in regression analysis by reducing unexplained variability Pearl (2009).

We can obtain length corrected AlpacaEval score in two steps: (i) first, we can fit a model

to these three attributes, and (ii) then we zero out the “length of output” term to obtain

counterfactual estimates of AlpacaEval win rate.

Specifically, for the first step, we will collect a list of ratings {x, zm, zb, m, b, y} from the

AlpacaEval leaderboard, and then fit a regression model qθ,ϕ,ψ to predict y from x, zm, zb, m, b.

The regression model.

Motivated by the previous discussion, we will model the AlpacaE-

val predictions f (zm, zb, x) with a logistic regression that has 3 terms: model, length, and

instruction. We will first present the overall regression formula, explain the details of the

featurization, and then describe some naturally appealing properties of our featurization.

The model and instruction terms are straightforward—they can be viewed as the log-linear

contribution of the model (m, b) and each instruction’s difficulty (γ) on the baseline win rate.

4

## Page 5

The length term is linear in a normalized length feature, where the normalizer standardizes

the length to have unit variance and transforms this via a tanh, as differences in lengths

should have strong diminishing returns on the log odds.

Importantly, this formula fulfills the identity property, i.e., q(y = 1 | zb, zb, b, b, x) = 0.5 ,

and symmetry property, i.e, q(y | zm, zb, b, m, x) = 1.0 −q(y | zb, zm, b, m, x) of the original

win rate. Identity holds as the length term is zero due to having no difference in length,

while the other two terms are zero as the coefficients are identical. For symmetry note that

logistic(x) = 1 −logistic(−x), and it is clear that swapping m and b flips the sign of the

model and instruction terms. For the length term, the same is true as flipping m and b

negates the length difference, and tanh is an odd function. More generally any additive

term that is antisymmetric and centered around 0 would satisfy the desired properties.

Obtaining length corrected (LC) win rate.

Using the model from Eq. (1) we can answer

the counterfactual question of what the automatic evaluation f might be if the length of the

evaluated model matched that of the base model, i.e., len(zm) = len(zb). In this case, the

second, length term becomes zero and we obtain the length corrected win rate estimate as

winrateLC(m, b) = 100 · Ex

(2)

i.e., we remove the length term from the regression and compute the implied win rate.

Training.

Training of the regression is simple and uses off-the-shelf libraries for fitting

generalized linear models. Since our GLM uses a logit link function, we fit the model in Eq 1

using the cross-entropy loss L(θ, ϕ, ψ) = Ep(y|zm,zb,m,b,x)p(zm,zb,m,b,x)



qθ,ϕ,ψ(y|zm, zb, m, b, x)

.

AlpacaEval’s leaderboard uses a constant baseline b, so without loss of generality we can

drop θb, ψb, which can be absorbed into the corresponding parameters for m. In total, for

a leaderboard with M models and N instructions, our GLM contains 3M + N parameters to

be estimated from MN examples (θm, ϕm,b, ψm for each model, γx for each instruction). This

will be overdetermined when M and N are both large, as in the case of AlpacaEval (M > 128,

N = 805). However, to ensure our procedure is robust even for small N and M, we use

5-fold cross-validation with L2 regularization on weights to avoid potential overfitting.

The one complexity of our regression is that the instruction difficulty term γx is shared

across models, and so we estimate this separately by first fitting a joint regression across all

models with the ψm −ψb term fixed to one and using the estimated γx from this regression.

For the remaining regression coefficients, we simply fit θ, ϕ, and ψ on the AlpacaEval predic-

tions for each model separately, re-using the already estimated γx as these do not depend

on the model being evaluated. Fitting models separately is important as it implies that

previously computed metrics won’t change when adding a new model to the leaderboard.

Of course, refitting γx would give a better estimate of that parameter, but we don’t think it

is worth constantly updating the leaderboard when a new model is added.

Finally, we added weak regularization on ϕm,b to prevent an adversary from performing

attacks that intentionally truncate sequences that a model performs poorly on. In this case,

the poor performance of the model would be perfectly correlated with the short length, and

the model builder would be able to exploit the length corrections to boost the performance

of the model. Adding a regularization term makes it so that any model performance

issues would be explained by the model terms first, and then any residual effects would

be captured by the length effects, as intended. The regularization is weak enough that we

empirically found it to not affect non-adversarial models.

Results

We apply our approach to all of AlpacaEval, as this benchmark has known length con-

founders, contains a large set of pre-computed LLM-based pairwise comparisons (> 120

models, 805 instructions), and is widely used by the research community. We evaluate our

approach on several measures of interest:

5

## Page 6

• Decreasing length gameability: We call a metric length gameable if simply prompting

the model to be more or less verbose significantly affects the metric outcome. Ideally,

length gameability should be low for two reasons. First, we would like evaluations that

prioritize the content rather than the style of the answer. Second, the benchmark should

not be too dependent on the prompting strategy as users usually think of evaluations of

models rather than the entire system, which includes the prompt.

• Correlation with Chatbot Arena: If our gameability and robustness metrics represent

better capturing human preference, we should improve our correlation with chatbot arena.

We measure Spearman rather than Pearson correlation as probabilities are log-linearly

correlated with ELO ratings, rather than linearly.

• Robustness and interpretability: Our corrected metric should be robust to simple adver-

sarial attacks such as truncation, and be interpretable to users as a win rate.

We show that AlpacaEval-LC fulfills all these goals. We release the code for all experiments.

Figure 3: Length-controlled AlpacaEval decreases the sensitivity to prompting the evaluated

model for more concise or verbose outputs.

4.1

AlpacaEval-LC decreases length gameability

A good evaluation metric should not be so sensitive to length that prompting for longer or

shorter responses completely changes the metric. To measure gameability we prompted dif-

ferent models to “Answer with as much detail as possible.” (verbose) or “Be as concise as pos-

sible while still providing all the necessary information to answer the question.” (concise).

Figure 3 shows that AlpacaEval is highly length gameable.

The baseline model

(gpt4_1106_preview) fluctuates from 22.9% to 64.3% by varying the verbosity instruc-

tion in the prompt. Even worse, significant gains are possible by asking weaker models to

be verbose, as seen with Claude-2.1.

In contrast, the length-controlled AlpacaEval has significantly lower gameability

(gpt4_1106_preview’s win rates now only fluctuate from 41.9% to 51.6%), and rankings are

generally stable to verbosity prompts. Quantitatively, the normalized standard deviation

across the three verbosity prompts decreases from 25% to 10% from the length control.

4.2

AlpacaEval-LC increases correlation with Chatbot Arena to 0.98

Our prior experiments demonstrate that length control reduces the high sensitivity to length

in AlpacaEval. However, our goal is not simply to make metrics that are less sensitive to

length, but to produce metrics that are overall more representative of human judgments.

Figure 1 shows that controlling for length increased the Spearman correlation with Chat

Arena from 0.94 to 0.98. Of existing benchmarks, this difference is significant enough to

make the length-corrected version of AlpacaEval the metric with the highest correlation

with Chat Arena which we are aware of. Correlations are computed on every benchmark

6

## Page 7

that evaluates at least 25 models from the Chatbot Arena. AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval-LC

have 38 such models, MT bench has 34. The bootstrap p-value comparing the correlation

with AlapcaEval’s correlation is 0.07 and 0.06 compared to MT-bench.

Length control generally improves the rankings of proprietary models.

Figure 4 shows

leaderboard changes due to our length control approach. We see that proprietary models,

which often generate shorter responses, perform much better on AlpacaEval-LC, and the

biggest rank losses are in open-source models that have gone through the RLHF process

Ouyang et al. (2022). Given that AlpacaEval is a potential optimization target for open-

source language models, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that existing open

models had exploited the length bias of AlpacaEval.

Figure 4: Closed source models often perform better (red) on length-controlled AlpacaEval

as they are often shorter. The first column shows the length of outputs. The 4th and 5th

columns, respectively, show the win rates and rank gains due to LC. The table shows the

top 15 and bottom 5 systems (separated by the dark gray line) on AlpacaEval’s leaderboard

from March 19th 2024.

4.3

AlpacaEval-LC is interpretable and robust

Regularization makes AlpacaEval-LC robust to truncation.

One potential issue with

simple bias corrections is that they may be gamed through white-box adversarial attacks,

e.g., postprocessing the outputs of models to make them look better on AlpacaEval-LC. One

example of such an attack is to truncate all outputs to a few characters, besides those that

are much better and around the same length as the baseline. A naive GLM fitted on such

outputs should naturally predict very high win rates in the counterfactual world where

outputs have the same length as the baseline. Indeed, when doing such post-processing

to GPT-4 outputs, win rates increase from 3.7 (AlpacaEval 2.0) to 25.9 (AlpacaEval-LC, no

regularization). To mitigate such adversarial attacks, our approach includes a regularization

term on ϕm,b. This decreases the gamed win rate to 12.2 (AlpacaEval-LC with regularization)

while having an imperceptible impact on non-adversarial models.

## Page 8

Figure 5: With our GLM we can predict what the win rate would be if the baseline was any

other model from the leaderboard. The x-axis shows the baseline, and the y-axis the model.

Both are in the same order.

Interpretability as a win rate.

Figure 5 shows that LC win rates can be interpreted similarly

to raw win rates. In particular, the baseline always has a win rate of 50% and winrate(m, b) =

100% −winrate(b, m) ∈[0%, 100%]. This seems very natural but wouldn’t hold for most

length-correction methods, such as normalizing by length.

More interestingly, a nice property of our GLM is that once we fit the weights for one

baseline, we can predict the win rate between any pair of models on the leaderboard. As a

result, we can predict the leaderboard for any other baseline as seen in Fig. 5.

Different length control methods

Let’s now briefly discuss two other potential family length-correction methods that have

been proposed in the community (Duong, 2024; Galambosi, 2024; Teortaxes, 2024).

Length-balanced win rate.

Another common way to control some covariates is through

stratification. One potential metric, dubbed length-balanced (LB) win rate, would thus be

to compute the average win rate stratified on examples where the model outputs are (1)

longer and (2) shorter than the baseline (Duong, 2024). LB satisfies many of the desiderata

of length control but has one main downside: robustness.

In particular, stratification relies upon having enough samples within each stratum, oth-

erwise the estimates may rapidly become unstable. This can increase variance, e.g., if one

model is naturally longer than another, but can also introduce adversarial vulnerabilities.

The first and last rows in Table 1 show that length-balanced win rates improve both the

length gameability (measured by the normalized standard deviation of win rate across

concise/standard/verbose prompts) and the Chatbot arena correlation. However, this

8

## Page 9

approach is strictly dominated by our length-controlled method—in terms of correlation

with Chatbot Arena, gameability, and adversarial win rate gains from truncating bad GPT-4

outputs as discussed in Section 4.3.

Length-normalized win rate.

Another option Galambosi (2024); Teortaxes (2024) is to

directly normalize the win rate by a function of the length of the model’s and baseline’s

output. We have tried several variations on normalization (e.g. directly dividing by lengths,

logistic function of lengths, etc). In our experiments, the function that performed best was

dividing the raw win rate by a temperature-scaled logistic function of the average difference

of lengths. We call this metric length-normalized (LN) win rate.

Table 1 shows that this simple LN win rate performs surprisingly well on many of the

metrics. We chose to present and implement the length-controlled (LC) win rate, as it

is more principled (as an estimate of the direct effect), interpretable (as a win rate), and

performs slightly better on all quantitative metrics except adversarial gameability.

Other biases.

Length is a well-known bias of automated evaluators of chatbot LLMs but

several others have been noted, including a bias of models towards their own outputs

(Zheng et al., 2023), or presence of lists (Dubois et al., 2023). While we focus on a more

detailed study of length biases here, we note that the same approaches can be applied to

other biases by representing them as additional features in the logistic regression.

Additionally, our preliminary explorations of self-annotator biases show that the effect

exists but is often smaller than general model differences. Table 2 shows that the ranking of

considered models does not change when using different annotators. In particular, Claude

3 Opus prefers GPT4 Preview, and Mistral Large prefers the former two than itself.

Length-controlling in RLHF.

Our work is closely related to the recent work that aims to

debias (implicit or explicit) reward models used to finetune LLMs with RLHF (Singhal et al.

(2023)). For example Shen et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2024) try to train a reward model that is

uncorrelated to length by making it predict the length at the same time as the reward and

disentangle the two. Park et al. (2024) extends this intuition to the case of implicit reward

models. This type of debiasing would not work out-of-the-box in typical auto-evaluation

settings, e.g. AlpacaEval, which uses closed-source LLM as judges rather than training a

reward model. Our post-hoc debiasing could however be used in the RLHF setting, and we

encourage future work to look into that.

Limitations.

Firstly, we only tested our proposed debiasing mechanism on the AlapcaEval

benchmark, which uses a set of relatively simple English instructions and a particular

prompt for the LLM judge. Secondly, AlpacaEval-LC is based on the simplifying assumption

that you would like to compare the model and the baseline as if they had the same length.

Finally, we do not (aim to) solve any other issues associated with the use of an LLM-judge

Zheng et al. (2023). Despite these limitations, we show that the correlation with Chatbot

9

## Page 10

Arena increases significantly, which suggests that AlpacaEval-LC takes a step in the right

direction.

Conclusion.

We propose a simple method for mitigating the length bias of LLM-based

automatic evaluations, specifically, AlpacaEval. The procedure consists of fitting a gener-

alized linear model to predict the auto-evaluators preferences, conditioned on the length

of the models’ output. We then get the length-controlled preference by predicting what

the auto-evaluator would have preferred if the model’s output and the baseline’s output

had the same length. We show that the resulting length-controlled AlpacaEval, has higher

correlations with humans, has much less length bias, and is robust (hard to game).
