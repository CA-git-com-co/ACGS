Abstract

This paper presents SimCSE, a simple con-

trastive learning framework that greatly ad-

vances state-of-the-art sentence embeddings.

We ﬁrst describe an unsupervised approach,

which takes an input sentence and predicts

itself in a contrastive objective, with only

standard dropout used as noise. This simple

method works surprisingly well, performing

on par with previous supervised counterparts.

We ﬁnd that dropout acts as minimal data aug-

mentation, and removing it leads to a repre-

sentation collapse. Then, we propose a super-

vised approach, which incorporates annotated

pairs from natural language inference datasets

into our contrastive learning framework by us-

ing “entailment” pairs as positives and “con-

tradiction” pairs as hard negatives. We evalu-

ate SimCSE on standard semantic textual simi-

larity (STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and

supervised models using BERTbase achieve

an average of 76.3% and 81.6% Spearman’s

correlation respectively, a 4.2% and 2.2%

improvement compared to the previous best

results.

We also show—both theoretically

and empirically—that the contrastive learning

objective regularizes pre-trained embeddings’

anisotropic space to be more uniform, and it

better aligns positive pairs when supervised

signals are available.1

Introduction

Learning universal sentence embeddings is a fun-

damental problem in natural language process-

ing and has been studied extensively in the litera-

ture (Kiros et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2016; Conneau

et al., 2017; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018; Cer et al.,

2018; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019, inter alia).

In this work, we advance state-of-the-art sentence

embedding methods and demonstrate that a con-

trastive objective can be extremely effective when

coupled with pre-trained language models such as

BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or RoBERTa (Liu et al.,

2019). We present SimCSE, a simple contrastive

sentence embedding framework, which can pro-

duce superior sentence embeddings, from either

unlabeled or labeled data.

Our unsupervised SimCSE simply predicts the

input sentence itself with only dropout (Srivastava

et al., 2014) used as noise (Figure 1(a)). In other

words, we pass the same sentence to the pre-trained

encoder twice: by applying the standard dropout

twice, we can obtain two different embeddings as

“positive pairs”. Then we take other sentences in

the same mini-batch as “negatives”, and the model

predicts the positive one among the negatives. Al-

though it may appear strikingly simple, this ap-

proach outperforms training objectives such as pre-

dicting next sentences (Logeswaran and Lee, 2018)

and discrete data augmentation (e.g., word dele-

tion and replacement) by a large margin, and even

matches previous supervised methods. Through

careful analysis, we ﬁnd that dropout acts as mini-

mal “data augmentation” of hidden representations

while removing it leads to a representation collapse.

Our supervised SimCSE builds upon the recent

success of using natural language inference (NLI)

datasets for sentence embeddings (Conneau et al.,

2017; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) and incorpo-

rates annotated sentence pairs in contrastive learn-

ing (Figure 1(b)). Unlike previous work that casts

it as a 3-way classiﬁcation task (entailment, neu-

tral, and contradiction), we leverage the fact that

entailment pairs can be naturally used as positive

instances. We also ﬁnd that adding correspond-

ing contradiction pairs as hard negatives further

improves performance. This simple use of NLI

datasets achieves a substantial improvement com-

pared to prior methods using the same datasets.

We also compare to other labeled sentence-pair

datasets and ﬁnd that NLI datasets are especially

effective for learning sentence embeddings.

To better understand the strong performance of

SimCSE, we borrow the analysis tool from Wang

and Isola (2020), which takes alignment between

semantically-related positive pairs and uniformity

of the whole representation space to measure the

quality of learned embeddings. Through empiri-

cal analysis, we ﬁnd that our unsupervised Sim-

CSE essentially improves uniformity while avoid-

ing degenerated alignment via dropout noise, thus

improving the expressiveness of the representa-

tions. The same analysis shows that the NLI train-

ing signal can further improve alignment between

positive pairs and produce better sentence embed-

dings. We also draw a connection to the recent ﬁnd-

ings that pre-trained word embeddings suffer from

anisotropy (Ethayarajh, 2019; Li et al., 2020) and

prove that—through a spectrum perspective—the

contrastive learning objective “ﬂattens” the singu-

lar value distribution of the sentence embedding

space, hence improving uniformity.

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Sim-

CSE on seven standard semantic textual similarity

(STS) tasks (Agirre et al., 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015,

2016; Cer et al., 2017; Marelli et al., 2014) and

seven transfer tasks (Conneau and Kiela, 2018).

On the STS tasks, our unsupervised and supervised

models achieve a 76.3% and 81.6% averaged Spear-

man’s correlation respectively using BERTbase, a

4.2% and 2.2% improvement compared to previous

best results. We also achieve competitive perfor-

mance on the transfer tasks. Finally, we identify

an incoherent evaluation issue in the literature and

consolidate the results of different settings for fu-

ture work in evaluation of sentence embeddings.

Background: Contrastive Learning

Contrastive learning aims to learn effective repre-

sentation by pulling semantically close neighbors

together and pushing apart non-neighbors (Hadsell

et al., 2006). It assumes a set of paired examples

D = {(xi, x+

i )}m

i=1, where xi and x+

i are semanti-

cally related. We follow the contrastive framework

in Chen et al. (2020) and take a cross-entropy ob-

jective with in-batch negatives (Chen et al., 2017;

Henderson et al., 2017): let hi and h+

i denote the

representations of xi and x+

i , the training objective

for (xi, x+

i ) with a mini-batch of N pairs is:

ℓi = −log

esim(hi,h+

i )/τ

## Pn

j=1 esim(hi,h+

j )/τ ,

(1)

where τ is a temperature hyperparameter and

sim(h1, h2) is the cosine similarity

h⊤

1 h2

∥h1∥·∥h2∥. In

this work, we encode input sentences using a

pre-trained language model such as BERT (De-

vlin et al., 2019) or RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019):

h = fθ(x), and then ﬁne-tune all the parameters

using the contrastive learning objective (Eq. 1).

Positive instances. One critical question in con-

trastive learning is how to construct (xi, x+

i ) pairs.

In visual representations, an effective solution is to

take two random transformations of the same image

(e.g., cropping, ﬂipping, distortion and rotation) as

xi and x+

i (Dosovitskiy et al., 2014). A similar

approach has been recently adopted in language

representations (Wu et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2021)

by applying augmentation techniques such as word

deletion, reordering, and substitution. However,

data augmentation in NLP is inherently difﬁcult

because of its discrete nature. As we will see in §3,

## Page 3

simply using standard dropout on intermediate rep-

resentations outperforms these discrete operators.

In NLP, a similar contrastive learning objective

has been explored in different contexts (Henderson

et al., 2017; Gillick et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al.,

2020). In these cases, (xi, x+

i ) are collected from

supervised datasets such as question-passage pairs.

Because of the distinct nature of xi and x+

i , these

approaches always use a dual-encoder framework,

i.e., using two independent encoders fθ1 and fθ2 for

xi and x+

i . For sentence embeddings, Logeswaran

and Lee (2018) also use contrastive learning with

a dual-encoder approach, by forming current sen-

tence and next sentence as (xi, x+

i ).

Alignment and uniformity. Recently, Wang and

Isola (2020) identify two key properties related to

contrastive learning—alignment and uniformity—

and propose to use them to measure the quality of

representations. Given a distribution of positive

pairs ppos, alignment calculates expected distance

between embeddings of the paired instances (as-

suming representations are already normalized):

ℓalign ≜

## E

(x,x+)∼ppos

∥f(x) −f(x+)∥2.

(2)

On the other hand, uniformity measures how well

the embeddings are uniformly distributed:

ℓuniform ≜log

## E

x,yi.i.d.

∼pdata

e−2∥f(x)−f(y)∥2,

(3)

where pdata denotes the data distribution. These

two metrics are well aligned with the objective

of contrastive learning: positive instances should

stay close and embeddings for random instances

should scatter on the hypersphere. In the following

sections, we will also use the two metrics to justify

the inner workings of our approaches.

3

Unsupervised SimCSE

The idea of unsupervised SimCSE is extremely

simple: we take a collection of sentences {xi}m

i=1

and use x+

i = xi. The key ingredient to get this to

work with identical positive pairs is through the use

of independently sampled dropout masks for xi and

x+

i . In standard training of Transformers (Vaswani

et al., 2017), there are dropout masks placed on

fully-connected layers as well as attention probabil-

ities (default p = 0.1). We denote hz

i = fθ(xi, z)

where z is a random mask for dropout. We simply

feed the same input to the encoder twice and get

Dropout noise as data augmentation. We view

it as a minimal form of data augmentation: the

positive pair takes exactly the same sentence, and

their embeddings only differ in dropout masks.

We compare this approach to other training ob-

jectives on the STS-B development set (Cer et al.,

data augmentation techniques such as crop, word

h = fθ(g(x), z) and g is a (random) discrete op-

erator on x. We note that even deleting one word

would hurt performance and none of the discrete

augmentations outperforms dropout noise.

We also compare this self-prediction training

objective to the next-sentence objective used in Lo-

geswaran and Lee (2018), taking either one encoder

or two independent encoders. As shown in Table 2,

we ﬁnd that SimCSE performs much better than

the next-sentence objectives (82.5 vs 67.4 on STS-

B) and using one encoder instead of two makes a

signiﬁcant difference in our approach.

Why does it work? To further understand the

role of dropout noise in unsupervised SimCSE, we

try out different dropout rates in Table 3 and ob-

serve that all the variants underperform the default

dropout probability p = 0.1 from Transformers.

We ﬁnd two extreme cases particularly interesting:

“no dropout” (p = 0) and “ﬁxed 0.1” (using default

dropout p = 0.1 but the same dropout masks for

the pair). In both cases, the resulting embeddings

for the pair are exactly the same, and it leads to

a dramatic performance degradation. We take the

checkpoints of these models every 10 steps during

training and visualize the alignment and uniformity

metrics3 in Figure 2, along with a simple data aug-

mentation model “delete one word”. As clearly

shown, starting from pre-trained checkpoints, all

models greatly improve uniformity. However, the

alignment of the two special variants also degrades

drastically, while our unsupervised SimCSE keeps

a steady alignment, thanks to the use of dropout

noise. It also demonstrates that starting from a pre-

trained checkpoint is crucial, for it provides good

initial alignment. At last, “delete one word” im-

proves the alignment yet achieves a smaller gain

on the uniformity metric, and eventually underper-

forms unsupervised SimCSE.

Supervised SimCSE

We have demonstrated that adding dropout noise

is able to keep a good alignment for positive pairs

(x, x+) ∼ppos. In this section, we study whether

we can leverage supervised datasets to provide

better training signals for improving alignment of

our approach. Prior work (Conneau et al., 2017;

Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) has demonstrated

that supervised natural language inference (NLI)

datasets (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al.,

2018) are effective for learning sentence embed-

dings, by predicting whether the relationship be-

tween two sentences is entailment, neutral or con-

tradiction. In our contrastive learning framework,

we instead directly take (xi, x+

i ) pairs from super-

vised datasets and use them to optimize Eq. 1.

Choices of labeled data. We ﬁrst explore which

supervised datasets are especially suitable for con-

structing positive pairs (xi, x+

i ). We experiment

with a number of datasets with sentence-pair ex-

amples, including 1) QQP4: Quora question pairs;

2) Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014): each image is

annotated with 5 human-written captions and we

consider any two captions of the same image as a

positive pair; 3) ParaNMT (Wieting and Gimpel,

2018): a large-scale back-translation paraphrase

dataset5; and ﬁnally 4) NLI datasets: SNLI (Bow-

man et al., 2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018).

We train the contrastive learning model (Eq. 1)

with different datasets and compare the results in

5ParaNMT is automatically constructed by machine trans-

lation systems. Strictly speaking, we should not call it “super-

vised”. It underperforms our unsupervised SimCSE though.

## Page 5

Table 4. For a fair comparison, we also run exper-

iments with the same # of training pairs. Among

all the options, using entailment pairs from the

NLI (SNLI + MNLI) datasets performs the best.

We think this is reasonable, as the NLI datasets

consist of high-quality and crowd-sourced pairs.

Also, human annotators are expected to write the

hypotheses manually based on the premises and

two sentences tend to have less lexical overlap.

For instance, we ﬁnd that the lexical overlap (F1

measured between two bags of words) for the en-

tailment pairs (SNLI + MNLI) is 39%, while they

are 60% and 55% for QQP and ParaNMT.

Contradiction as hard negatives. Finally, we fur-

ther take the advantage of the NLI datasets by us-

ing its contradiction pairs as hard negatives6. In

NLI datasets, given one premise, annotators are re-

quired to manually write one sentence that is abso-

lutely true (entailment), one that might be true (neu-

tral), and one that is deﬁnitely false (contradiction).

Therefore, for each premise and its entailment hy-

pothesis, there is an accompanying contradiction

hypothesis7 (see Figure 1 for an example).

Formally, we extend (xi, x+

i ) to (xi, x+

i , x−

i ),

where xi is the premise, x+

i and x−

i are entailment

and contradiction hypotheses. The training objec-

tive ℓi is then deﬁned by (N is mini-batch size):

As shown in Table 4, adding hard negatives can

further improve performance (84.9 →86.2) and

this is our ﬁnal supervised SimCSE. We also tried

to add the ANLI dataset (Nie et al., 2020) or com-

bine it with our unsupervised SimCSE approach,

but didn’t ﬁnd a meaningful improvement. We also

considered a dual encoder framework in supervised

SimCSE and it hurt performance (86.2 →84.2).

Connection to Anisotropy

Recent work identiﬁes an anisotropy problem in

language representations (Ethayarajh, 2019; Li

et al., 2020), i.e., the learned embeddings occupy a

narrow cone in the vector space, which severely

limits their expressiveness.

Gao et al. (2019)

6We also experimented with adding neutral hypotheses as

hard negatives. See Section 6.3 for more discussion.

7In fact, one premise can have multiple contradiction hy-

potheses. In our implementation, we only sample one as the

hard negative and we did not ﬁnd a difference by using more.

demonstrate that language models trained with tied

input/output embeddings lead to anisotropic word

embeddings, and this is further observed by Etha-

yarajh (2019) in pre-trained contextual representa-

tions. Wang et al. (2020) show that singular values

of the word embedding matrix in a language model

decay drastically: except for a few dominating sin-

gular values, all others are close to zero.

A simple way to alleviate the problem is post-

processing, either to eliminate the dominant prin-

cipal components (Arora et al., 2017; Mu and

Viswanath, 2018), or to map embeddings to an

isotropic distribution (Li et al., 2020; Su et al.,

2021). Another common solution is to add reg-

ularization during training (Gao et al., 2019; Wang

et al., 2020). In this work, we show that—both

theoretically and empirically—the contrastive ob-

jective can also alleviate the anisotropy problem.

The anisotropy problem is naturally connected to

uniformity (Wang and Isola, 2020), both highlight-

ing that embeddings should be evenly distributed

in the space. Intuitively, optimizing the contrastive

learning objective can improve uniformity (or ease

the anisotropy problem), as the objective pushes

negative instances apart. Here, we take a singular

spectrum perspective—which is a common practice

8Though our ﬁnal model only takes entailment pairs as

positive instances, here we also try taking neutral and contra-

diction pairs from the NLI datasets as positive pairs.

in analyzing word embeddings (Mu and Viswanath,

2018; Gao et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020), and

show that the contrastive objective can “ﬂatten” the

singular value distribution of sentence embeddings

and make the representations more isotropic.

Following Wang and Isola (2020), the asymp-

totics of the contrastive learning objective (Eq. 1)

can be expressed by the following equation when

the number of negative instances approaches inﬁn-

ity (assuming f(x) is normalized):

where the ﬁrst term keeps positive instances similar

and the second pushes negative pairs apart. When

hi = f(xi), we can derive the following formula

from the second term with Jensen’s inequality:

Let W be the sentence embedding matrix corre-

sponding to {xi}m

i=1, i.e., the i-th row of W is

hi. Optimizing the second term in Eq. 6 essen-

tially minimizes an upper bound of the summation

of all elements in WW⊤, i.e., Sum(WW⊤) =

Pm

i=1

Pm

j=1 h⊤

i hj.

Since we normalize hi, all elements on the di-

agonal of WW⊤are 1 and then tr(WW⊤) (the

sum of all eigenvalues) is a constant. According

to Merikoski (1984), if all elements in WW⊤are

positive, which is the case in most times accord-

ing to Figure G.1, then Sum(WW⊤) is an upper

bound for the largest eigenvalue of WW⊤. When

minimizing the second term in Eq. 6, we reduce

the top eigenvalue of WW⊤and inherently “ﬂat-

ten” the singular spectrum of the embedding space.

Therefore, contrastive learning is expected to alle-

viate the representation degeneration problem and

improve uniformity of sentence embeddings.

Compared to post-processing methods in Li et al.

(2020); Su et al. (2021), which only aim to encour-

age isotropic representations, contrastive learning

also optimizes for aligning positive pairs by the

ﬁrst term in Eq. 6, which is the key to the success

of SimCSE. A quantitative analysis is given in §7.

Evaluation Setup

We conduct our experiments on 7 semantic textual

similarity (STS) tasks. Note that all our STS exper-

iments are fully unsupervised and no STS training

sets are used. Even for supervised SimCSE, we

simply mean that we take extra labeled datasets

for training, following previous work (Conneau

et al., 2017). We also evaluate 7 transfer learning

tasks and provide detailed results in Appendix E.

We share a similar sentiment with Reimers and

Gurevych (2019) that the main goal of sentence

embeddings is to cluster semantically similar sen-

tences and hence take STS as the main result.

son patterns in published papers in the evaluation

settings, including (a) whether to use an additional

regressor, (b) Spearman’s vs Pearson’s correlation,

and (c) how the results are aggregated (Table B.1).

We discuss the detailed differences in Appendix B

and choose to follow the setting of Reimers and

Gurevych (2019) in our evaluation (no additional

regressor, Spearman’s correlation, and “all” aggre-

gation). We also report our replicated study of

previous work as well as our results evaluated in

a different setting in Table B.2 and Table B.3. We

call for unifying the setting in evaluating sentence

embeddings for future research.

Training details. We start from pre-trained check-

points of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) (uncased)

or RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) (cased) and take

the [CLS] representation as the sentence embed-

ding9 (see §6.3 for comparison between different

pooling methods). We train unsupervised SimCSE

on 106 randomly sampled sentences from English

Wikipedia, and train supervised SimCSE on the

combination of MNLI and SNLI datasets (314k).

More training details can be found in Appendix A.

9There is an MLP layer over [CLS] in BERT’s original

implementation and we keep it with random initialization.

Main Results

We compare unsupervised and supervised Sim-

CSE to previous state-of-the-art sentence embed-

ding methods on STS tasks. Unsupervised base-

lines include average GloVe embeddings (Pen-

nington et al., 2014), average BERT or RoBERTa

embeddings10, and post-processing methods such

as BERT-ﬂow (Li et al., 2020) and BERT-

whitening (Su et al., 2021). We also compare to sev-

eral recent methods using a contrastive objective,

including 1) IS-BERT (Zhang et al., 2020), which

maximizes the agreement between global and lo-

cal features; 2) DeCLUTR (Giorgi et al., 2021),

which takes different spans from the same docu-

ment as positive pairs; 3) CT (Carlsson et al., 2021),

which aligns embeddings of the same sentence

from two different encoders.11 Other supervised

10Following Su et al. (2021), we take the average of the ﬁrst

and the last layers, which is better than only taking the last.

11We do not compare to CLEAR (Wu et al., 2020), because

they use their own version of pre-trained models, and the

numbers appear to be much lower. Also note that CT is a

concurrent work to ours.

methods include InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017),

Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018), and

SBERT/SRoBERTa (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019)

with post-processing methods (BERT-ﬂow, whiten-

ing, and CT). We provide more details of these

baselines in Appendix C.

Table 5 shows the evaluation results on 7 STS

tasks. SimCSE can substantially improve results

on all the datasets with or without extra NLI su-

pervision, greatly outperforming the previous state-

of-the-art models. Speciﬁcally, our unsupervised

SimCSE-BERTbase improves the previous best

averaged Spearman’s correlation from 72.05% to

76.25%, even comparable to supervised baselines.

When using NLI datasets, SimCSE-BERTbase fur-

ther pushes the state-of-the-art results to 81.57%.

The gains are more pronounced on RoBERTa

encoders, and our supervised SimCSE achieves

83.76% with RoBERTalarge.

In Appendix E, we show that SimCSE also

achieves on par or better transfer task performance

compared to existing work, and an auxiliary MLM

objective can further boost performance.

Ablation Studies

We investigate the impact of different pooling meth-

ods and hard negatives. All reported results in this

section are based on the STS-B development set.

We provide more ablation studies (normalization,

temperature, and MLM objectives) in Appendix D.

Pooling methods. Reimers and Gurevych (2019);

Li et al. (2020) show that taking the average em-

beddings of pre-trained models (especially from

both the ﬁrst and last layers) leads to better perfor-

mance than [CLS]. Table 6 shows the comparison

between different pooling methods in both unsuper-

vised and supervised SimCSE. For [CLS] repre-

sentation, the original BERT implementation takes

an extra MLP layer on top of it. Here, we consider

three different settings for [CLS]: 1) keeping the

MLP layer; 2) no MLP layer; 3) keeping MLP dur-

ing training but removing it at testing time. We ﬁnd

that for unsupervised SimCSE, taking [CLS] rep-

resentation with MLP only during training works

the best; for supervised SimCSE, different pooling

methods do not matter much. By default, we take

[CLS]with MLP (train) for unsupervised SimCSE

and [CLS]with MLP for supervised SimCSE.

Hard negatives. Intuitively, it may be beneﬁcial

to differentiate hard negatives (contradiction exam-

ples) from other in-batch negatives. Therefore, we

extend our training objective deﬁned in Eq. 5 to

incorporate weighting of different negatives:

−log

esim(hi,h+

i )/τ

## Pn

j=1



esim(hi,h+

j )/τ + α1j

i esim(hi,h−

j )/τ, (8)

where 1j

i ∈{0, 1} is an indicator that equals 1 if

and only if i = j. We train SimCSE with different

values of α and evaluate the trained models on

the development set of STS-B. We also consider

taking neutral hypotheses as hard negatives. As

shown in Table 7, α = 1 performs the best, and

neutral hypotheses do not bring further gains.

7

Analysis

In this section, we conduct further analyses to un-

derstand the inner workings of SimCSE.

Uniformity and alignment. Figure 3 shows uni-

formity and alignment of different sentence embed-

ding models along with their averaged STS results.

In general, models which have both better align-

ment and uniformity achieve better performance,

conﬁrming the ﬁndings in Wang and Isola (2020).

We also observe that (1) though pre-trained em-

beddings have good alignment, their uniformity is

poor (i.e., the embeddings are highly anisotropic);

(2) post-processing methods like BERT-ﬂow and

BERT-whitening greatly improve uniformity but

also suffer a degeneration in alignment; (3) unsu-

pervised SimCSE effectively improves uniformity

of pre-trained embeddings whereas keeping a good

alignment; (4) incorporating supervised data in

SimCSE further amends alignment. In Appendix F,

we further show that SimCSE can effectively ﬂat-

ten singular value distribution of pre-trained em-

beddings. In Appendix G, we demonstrate that

SimCSE provides more distinguishable cosine sim-

ilarities between different sentence pairs.

Qualitative comparison.

We conduct a small-

scale retrieval experiment using SBERTbase and

SimCSE-BERTbase. We use 150k captions from

Flickr30k dataset and take any random sentence as

query to retrieve similar sentences (based on cosine

similarity). As several examples shown in Table 8,

the retrieved sentences by SimCSE have a higher

quality compared to those retrieved by SBERT.

et al., 2016; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018). Pagliar-

dini et al. (2018) show that simply augmenting

the idea of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) with

n-gram embeddings leads to strong results. Sev-

eral recent (and concurrent) approaches adopt con-

trastive objectives (Zhang et al., 2020; Giorgi et al.,

2021; Wu et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2021; Carlsson

et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021) by

taking different views—from data augmentation or

different copies of models—of the same sentence

or document. Compared to these work, SimCSE

uses the simplest idea by taking different outputs

of the same sentence from standard dropout, and

performs the best on STS tasks.

Supervised sentence embeddings are promised

to have stronger performance compared to unsu-

pervised counterparts. Conneau et al. (2017) pro-

pose to ﬁne-tune a Siamese model on NLI datasets,

which is further extended to other encoders or

pre-trained models (Cer et al., 2018; Reimers and

Gurevych, 2019). Furthermore, Wieting and Gim-

pel (2018); Wieting et al. (2020) demonstrate that

bilingual and back-translation corpora provide use-

ful supervision for learning semantic similarity. An-

other line of work focuses on regularizing embed-

dings (Li et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021; Huang et al.,

2021) to alleviate the representation degeneration

problem (as discussed in §5), and yields substantial

improvement over pre-trained language models.

Conclusion

In this work, we propose SimCSE, a simple con-

trastive learning framework, which greatly im-

proves state-of-the-art sentence embeddings on se-

mantic textual similarity tasks. We present an un-

supervised approach which predicts input sentence

itself with dropout noise and a supervised approach

utilizing NLI datasets. We further justify the inner

workings of our approach by analyzing alignment

and uniformity of SimCSE along with other base-

line models. We believe that our contrastive objec-

tive, especially the unsupervised one, may have a

broader application in NLP. It provides a new per-

spective on data augmentation with text input, and

can be extended to other continuous representations

and integrated in language model pre-training.

Training Details

We implement SimCSE with transformers

package (Wolf et al., 2020). For supervised Sim-

CSE, we train our models for 3 epochs, evaluate the

model every 250 training steps on the development

set of STS-B and keep the best checkpoint for the

ﬁnal evaluation on test sets. We do the same for

the unsupervised SimCSE, except that we train the

model for one epoch. We carry out grid-search of

batch size ∈{64, 128, 256, 512} and learning rate

∈{1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5} on STS-B development set

and adopt the hyperparameter settings in Table A.1.

We ﬁnd that SimCSE is not sensitive to batch sizes

as long as tuning the learning rates accordingly,

which contradicts the ﬁnding that contrastive learn-

ing requires large batch sizes (Chen et al., 2020).

It is probably due to that all SimCSE models start

from pre-trained checkpoints, which already pro-

vide us a good set of initial parameters.

Table A.1: Batch sizes and learning rates for SimCSE.

For both unsupervised and supervised SimCSE,

we take the [CLS] representation with an MLP

layer on top of it as the sentence representation.

Specially, for unsupervised SimCSE, we discard

the MLP layer and only use the [CLS] output

during test, since we ﬁnd that it leads to better

performance (ablation study in §6.3).

Finally, we introduce one more optional variant

which adds a masked language modeling (MLM)

objective (Devlin et al., 2019) as an auxiliary loss

to Eq. 1: ℓ+ λ · ℓmlm (λ is a hyperparameter).

This helps SimCSE avoid catastrophic forgetting

of token-level knowledge. As we will show in Ta-

ble D.2, we ﬁnd that adding this term can help

improve performance on transfer tasks (not on

sentence-level STS tasks).

## B

Different Settings for STS Evaluation

We elaborate the differences in STS evaluation set-

tings in previous work in terms of (a) whether to

use additional regressors; (b) reported metrics; (c)

different ways to aggregate results.

Additional regressors. The default SentEval

implementation applies a linear regressor on top of

frozen sentence embeddings for STS-B and SICK-

R, and train the regressor on the training sets of

the two tasks, while most sentence representation

papers take the raw embeddings and evaluate in an

unsupervised way. In our experiments, we do not

apply any additional regressors and directly take

cosine similarities for all STS tasks.

Metrics. Both Pearson’s and Spearman’s cor-

relation coefﬁcients are used in the literature.

Reimers et al. (2016) argue that Spearman corre-

lation, which measures the rankings instead of the

actual scores, better suits the need of evaluating

sentence embeddings. For all of our experiments,

we report Spearman’s rank correlation.

Aggregation methods. Given that each year’s

STS challenge contains several subsets, there are

different choices to gather results from them: one

way is to concatenate all the topics and report the

overall Spearman’s correlation (denoted as “all”),

and the other is to calculate results for differ-

ent subsets separately and average them (denoted

as “mean” if it is simple average or “wmean” if

weighted by the subset sizes). However, most pa-

pers do not claim the method they take, making it

challenging for a fair comparison. We take some

of the most recent work: SBERT (Reimers and

Gurevych, 2019), BERT-ﬂow (Li et al., 2020) and

BERT-whitening (Su et al., 2021)12 as an example:

In Table B.2, we compare our reproduced results

to reported results of SBERT and BERT-whitening,

and ﬁnd that Reimers and Gurevych (2019) take the

“all” setting but Li et al. (2020); Su et al. (2021) take

the “wmean” setting, even though Li et al. (2020)

claim that they take the same setting as Reimers

12Li et al. (2020) and Su et al. (2021) have consistent results,

so we assume that they take the same evaluation and just take

BERT-whitening in experiments here.

Table B.3: STS results with “wmean” setting (Spearman). ♠: from Li et al. (2020); Su et al. (2021).

and Gurevych (2019). Since the “all” setting fuses

data from different topics together, it makes the

evaluation closer to real-world scenarios, and un-

less speciﬁed, we take the “all” setting.

We list evaluation settings for a number of pre-

vious work in Table B.1. Some of the settings are

reported by the paper and some of them are inferred

by comparing the results and checking their code.

As we can see, the evaluation protocols are very

incoherent across different papers. We call for uni-

fying the setting in evaluating sentence embeddings

for future research. We will also release our evalua-

tion code for better reproducibility. Since previous

work uses different evaluation protocols from ours,

we further evaluate our models in these settings to

make a direct comparison to the published num-

bers. We evaluate SimCSE with “wmean” and

Spearman’s correlation to directly compare to Li

et al. (2020) and Su et al. (2021) in Table B.3.

## C

Baseline Models

We elaborate on how we obtain different baselines

for comparison in our experiments:

• For average GloVe embedding (Pennington

et al., 2014), InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017)

and Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al.,

2018), we directly report the results from

Reimers and Gurevych (2019), since our eval-

uation setting is the same as theirs.

• For BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa

(Liu et al., 2019), we download the pre-

trained model weights from HuggingFace’s

Transformers13, and evaluate the models

with our own scripts.

• For SBERT and SRoBERTa (Reimers and

Gurevych, 2019), we reuse the results from

the original paper. For results not reported

by Reimers and Gurevych (2019), such as the

performance of SRoBERTa on transfer tasks,

we download the model weights from Sen-

tenceTransformers14 and evaluate them.

• For DeCLUTR (Giorgi et al., 2021) and con-

trastive tension (Carlsson et al., 2021), we

reevaluate their checkpoints in our setting.

• For BERT-ﬂow (Li et al., 2020), since their

original numbers take a different setting, we

retrain their models using their code15, and

evaluate the models using our own script.

• For BERT-whitening (Su et al., 2021), we im-

plemented our own version of whitening script

following the same pooling method in Su et al.

(2021), i.e. ﬁrst-last average pooling. Our im-

plementation can reproduce the results from

the original paper (see Table B.2).

For both BERT-ﬂow and BERT-whitening, they

have two variants of postprocessing: one takes the

NLI data (“NLI”) and one directly learns the em-

bedding distribution on the target sets (“target”).

We ﬁnd that in our evaluation setting, “target” is

generally worse than “NLI” (Table C.1), so we only

report the NLI variant in the main results.

## D

Ablation Studies

Normalization and temperature. We train Sim-

CSE using both dot product and cosine similarity

with different temperatures and evaluate them on

the STS-B development set. As shown in Table D.1,

with a carefully tuned temperature τ = 0.05, co-

sine similarity is better than dot product.

## E

Transfer Tasks

We evaluate our models on the following trans-

fer tasks: MR (Pang and Lee, 2005), CR (Hu

and Liu, 2004), SUBJ (Pang and Lee, 2004),

MPQA (Wiebe et al., 2005), SST-2 (Socher et al.,

2013), TREC (Voorhees and Tice, 2000) and

MRPC (Dolan and Brockett, 2005). A logistic re-

gression classiﬁer is trained on top of (frozen) sen-

tence embeddings produced by different methods.

We follow default conﬁgurations from SentEval16.

Table E.1 shows the evaluation results on trans-

fer tasks. We ﬁnd that supervised SimCSE per-

forms on par or better than previous approaches,

although the trend of unsupervised models remains

unclear. We ﬁnd that adding this MLM term con-

sistently improves performance on transfer tasks,

conﬁrming our intuition that sentence-level objec-

tive may not directly beneﬁt transfer tasks. We also

experiment with post-processing methods (BERT-

ﬂow/whitening) and ﬁnd that they both hurt per-

formance compared to their base models, showing

that good uniformity of representations does not

lead to better embeddings for transfer learning. As

we argued earlier, we think that transfer tasks are

not a major goal for sentence embeddings, and thus

we take the STS results for main comparison.

## F

Distribution of Singular Values

Figure F.1 shows the singular value distribution of

SimCSE together with other baselines. For both

unsupervised and supervised cases, singular value

drops the fastest for vanilla BERT or SBERT em-

beddings, while SimCSE helps ﬂatten the spectrum

distribution. Postprocessing-based methods such

as BERT-ﬂow or BERT-whitening ﬂatten the curve

even more since they directly aim for the goal of

mapping embeddings to an isotropic distribution.

on STS tasks, we illustrate the cosine similarity dis-

tributions of STS-B pairs with different groups of

human ratings in Figure G.1. Compared to all the

baseline models, both unsupervised and supervised

SimCSE better distinguish sentence pairs with dif-

ferent levels of similarities, thus leading to a better

performance on STS tasks. In addition, we observe

that SimCSE generally shows a more scattered dis-

tribution than BERT or SBERT, but also preserves

a lower variance on semantically similar sentence

pairs compared to whitened distribution. This ob-

servation further validates that SimCSE can achieve

a better alignment-uniformity balance.
