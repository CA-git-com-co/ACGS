Abstract

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-

back (RLHF) has been a crucial component

in the recent success of Large Language Mod-

els. However, RLHF is know to exploit biases

in human preferences, such as verbosity. A

well-formatted and eloquent answer is often

more highly rated by users, even when it is

less helpful and objective. A number of ap-

proaches have been developed to control those

biases in the classical RLHF literature, but the

problem remains relatively under-explored for

Direct Alignment Algorithms such as Direct

Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike classi-

cal RLHF, DPO does not train a separate reward

model or use reinforcement learning directly, so

previous approaches developed to control ver-

bosity cannot be directly applied to this setting.

Our work makes several contributions. For the

first time, we study the length problem in the

DPO setting, showing significant exploitation

in DPO and linking it to out-of-distribution

bootstrapping. We then develop a principled

but simple regularization strategy that prevents

length exploitation while still maintaining im-

provements in model quality. We demonstrate

these effects across datasets on summarization

and dialogue, where we achieve up to 20% im-

provement in win rates when controlling for

length, despite the GPT-4 judge’s well-known

verbosity bias.

Introduction

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have

seen significant improvements in capabilities, such

as code-generation, mathematical reasoning, and

tool use. Importantly, they can now fluently inter-

act with users and follow their instructions, leading

to their widespread adoption. Fine-tuning with

(Liu, 2024) on the Alpaca Eval benchmark (Dubois

et al., 2024). While the highest-scoring open-source

models can match the overall performance of strong

closed models, they lag significantly on length-corrected

basis.

2022) has been a significant component in those ad-

vances and is now a standard part of advanced LLM

training pipelines (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al.,

2022a; Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024; Anil

et al., 2023). Currently, all the leading LLMs de-

ploy some sort of RLHF pipeline (Dubois et al.,

2024; Zheng et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023). The

classical approach consists of three-stages. The

first stage begins with a general model pre-trained

with next-token prediction on a large corpus of text

(Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), which

is then further-tuned for instruction-following pur-

poses (Wei et al., 2022). In the second stage, the

model is prompted with general requests, and gen-

erates multiple possible answers, which are then

ranked by the user. These ratings are used to train

a reward model, which represents human prefer-

ences (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2022;

Ziegler et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2022a; Touvron et al.,

2023). In the final stage, the instruction-tuned LLM

is further trained to maximize expected rewards

from the previously trained reward model (a proxy

for user preferences) using general purpose rein-

forcement learning algorithms (Schulman et al.,

2017; Mnih et al., 2016). While successful, this

pipeline is technically complex and computation-

ally expensive, mainly due to the final stage of RL

optimization.

The quality of the learned reward model is

crucial for the RLHF process (Touvron et al.,

2023). However, prior works have demonstrated

that reward models can be exploited (Casper et al.,

2023; Gao et al., 2023) due to a Goodhart’s law

effect (Clark and Amodei, 2016; Manheim and

Garrabrant, 2019; Skalse et al., 2022; Lambert

and Calandra, 2023). Under this phenomenon, the

model can achieve high rewards during the RL

training while generating undesirable behaviours

(Gao et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2024). A particu-

lar case of the reward exploitation phenomenon is

the well-known verbosity issue - models fine-tuned

with RLHF generate significantly longer answers,

without necessarily improving the actual quality

(Singhal et al., 2023; Kabir et al., 2023). This

has been linked to an explicit bias in the prefer-

ence data towards longer responses (Singhal et al.,

2023). However, the statistical increase in verbosity

of RLHF-trained models significantly outmatches

the the difference of distribution lengths between

the preferred and rejected answers. This effect is

even observed in in strong propriety models, such

as GPT-4 (John Schulman et al., 2022), which is

now frequently used to evaluate the performance

of other LLMs (Dubois et al., 2024; Zheng et al.,

2023; Zeng et al., 2023). However, even as an eval-

uator, GPT-4 exhibits strong preferences for length.

Prior work (Wang et al., 2023) has noted that when

evaluating 13B parameter models in head-to-head

comparisons with the Davinci-003 model, win rates

and the average number of unique tokens in the

model’s response have correlation of 0.96.

Recently,

Direct

Preference

Optimization

(Rafailov et al., 2023) has emerged as an alter-

native to the standard RLHF pipeline. The key

observation of DPO is that the reward model can

directly be re-parameterized through the optimal

LLM policy obtained in the reinforcement learning

stage. This allows us to directly train the language

model through the reward learning pipeline,

eliminating the need for the reinforcement learning

stage. This algorithm has become widely used,

since it can train completely offline, yielding better

simplicity of tuning, speed, and resource efficiency,

## Page 3

while still maintaining performance (Dubois et al.,

2024; Jiang et al., 2024). For these reasons, it

has also been widely adopted by the open-source

community. At the time of this writing, 9 out of

the top 10 models on the HuggingFace Open LLM

Leaderboard use DPO as part of their training

pipeline.

While the question of length exploitation has

been extensively studied in the classical RLHF

pipeline, it has not been explored in the DPO set-

ting. RLHF-style reward models are explicit, mak-

ing them susceptible to issues like reward overopti-

mization (Gao et al., 2023). It is unclear whether

these issues transfer to DPO, where the lack of an

explicit reward model means the problem of reward

overoptimization is harder to define. To complicate

this issue, others have argued that apparent gains in

open-source model performance across automated

benchmarks are driven by evaluator’s verbosity bias

(Liu, 2024). These statistics are demonstrated in

Figure 1, as open-source models can match the

overall performance of proprietary ones, but lag

significantly on length-corrected basis.

We make several contributions in our work:

First, we show the length exploitation is quite preva-

lent in DPO. We demonstrate empirically (for the

first time) that in this settings OOD extrapolation

issues emerge similarly to classical RLHF. Next,

we derive a simple but efficient regularization ap-

proach, showing it can effectively control verbosity

and minimally impact performance even under a

length-biased judge which also explains other em-

pirical phenomena in DPO training, such as early

convergence.

Preliminaries

In this section, we will outline the core compo-

nents of the standard RLHF pipeline Ziegler et al.;

Stiennon et al.; Bai et al.; Ouyang et al.) and the Di-

rect Preference Optimization algorithm (Rafailov

et al., 2023), which is central to our analysis and

regularization derivations.

2.1

Reinforcement Learning From Human

Feedback

The standard RLHF pipeline consists of three

stages: 1) we first pre-train a general LLM for

instruction-following purposes with supervised

fine-tuning (SFT); 2) next, we gather human feed-

back and train a parameterized reward model; 3)

we further optimize the LLM in a reinforcement

learning loop using the trained reward model.

SFT: During this stage, we use a dataset of prompts

x and high-quality answers y to train an LLM with

next-token prediction to obtain a model πSFT(y|x).

In our notation, we treat the entire prompt and

answer strings as a single variable.

Reward modeling Phase: In the second phase the

instruction-tuned model is given prompts x, and

produces pairs of answers (y1, y2) ∼πSFT(y|x).

Users then rank the answers. We denote these pref-

erences as yw ≻yl | x, where yw and yl are

the preferred and dispreferred answer. The rank-

ings are usually assumed to be generated by the

Bradley-Terry (BT) (Bradley and Terry, 1952), in

which the preference distribution p is assumed to

be driven by an unobserved latent reward r(x, y)

and the following parametrization:

p(y1 ≻y2 | x) =

exp (r(x, y1))

exp (r(x, y1)) + exp (r(x, y2)).

(1)

Then, given a dataset of user rankings D

x(i), y(i)

l

## N

i=1, we can train a parameterized

reward model rϕ(x, y) using maximum likelihood:

LR(rϕ, D) =

−E(x,yw,yl)∼D



log σ(rϕ(x, yw) −rϕ(x, yl))



(2)

where σ is the logistic function.

Reinforcement Learning Phase: During the fi-

nal phase, we use the learned reward function in

an RL loop where the LLM is treated as a policy.

The most common optimization objective is the

following:

max

πθ Ex∼D,y∼πθ(y|x)



rϕ(x, y)



−

βDKL



πθ(y | x) || πref(y|x)



(3)

where πref(y|x) is a reference distribution (usually

taken to be πref(y|x)) and β is a hyper-parameter.

This objective trades off maximizing the reward

rϕ(x, y) and the regularizing divergence term,

which prevents the policy from drifting far from

πref(y|x). This objective is then optimized using a

general purpose RL algorithm, such as PPO (Schul-

man et al., 2017).

2.2

Direct Preference Optimization

Direct Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al.,

2023) starts with the same objective as Eq. 3. How-

ever, DPO assumes we have access to the ground

## Page 4

truth reward r(x, y) and derives an analytical trans-

formation between the optimal reward and optimal

policy. This can be substituted back into the reward

optimization objective in Eq. 2, which allows us

to train the optimal model directly on the feedback

data using the following objective:

LDPO (πθ; πref) =

−E(x,yw,yl)∼D

h

log σ



β log πθ (yw | x)

πref (yw | x)−

β log πθ (yl | x)

πref (yl | x)

i

(4)

Here, the parameter β is the same as in Eq. 3, and

similarly controls the trade-off between expected

reward and divergence from the model initializa-

tion. The DPO objective is attractive since it allows

us to recover the optimal model using a standard

classification loss, without the need for on-policy

sampling or significant amount of hyper-parameter

tuning. Eq. 4 resembles the reward modeling ob-

jective in Eq. 2 under the parameterization

rθ(x, y) = β log πθ (y | x)

πref (y | x)

(5)

We will refer to this as the DPO "implicit re-

ward". Theorem 1 in (Rafailov et al., 2023) shows

that this is indeed a valid parameterization of a

reward model without loss of generality. If we sub-

stitute this form of rθ(x, y) into the RL objective

3, we can obtain the optimal solution in a closed

form, which happens to be πθ. We will return to the

interpretation of DPO as an implicit reward func-

tion later on in our analysis of out-of-distribution

bootstrapping.

Building in Explicit Regularization in

## Dpo

Prior works have explicitly considered length-

regularization in the classical RLHF pipeline (Sing-

hal et al., 2023), however these methods do not

transfer directly to direct alignment algorithms,

such as DPO (Rosset et al., 2024).

We derive

a length-regularized version of the algorithm by

adding a regularized term to Eq. 3. The below

considerations hold for a general regularizer, but

we focus on a length term α|y|, where α is a hyper-

parameter and |y| denotes the token-length of the

answer y. We then formulate the regularized RL

problems in the following objective:

max

πθ Ex∼D,y∼πθ(y|x)



r(x, y)



−α|y|−

βDKL



πθ(y | x) || πref(y|x)



(6)

where we assume that r(x, y) is still the same la-

tent reward driving human preferences. We can fol-

low the same derivations in (Rafailov et al., 2023)

for the reward function r(x, y)



−α|y| and obtain

the optimal solution to Eq. 6 as

π∗(y|x) =

1

Z(x)πrefe

1

β (r(x,y)−α|y|)

(7)

where Z(x) = P

y πrefe

1

β (r(x,y)−α|y|). With some

simple algebra, we can then obtain the equivalent

regularized reward re-formulation:

r(x, y) = β log π∗(y|x)

πref(y|x) + β log Z(x) + α|y|

(8)

We can then plug in Eq. 8 into the reward mod-

eling stage in Eq. 2, which yields the following

regularized DPO objective:

LR−DPO (πθ; πref) =

−E(x,yw,yl)∼D

h

log σ



β log πθ (yw | y)

πref (yw | x)−

β log πθ (yl | x)

πref (yl | x)+

(α|yw| −α|yl|)

i

(9)

This is similar to the standard DPO objective, ex-

cept for an additional regularization term (α|yw| −

α|yl|) in the logit of the binary classification loss.

Recent work (Zhou et al., 2023), aims to develop a

multi-objective optimization approach and arrives

at a similar objective involving a mixture of reward

models, while we focus on optimization robustness

of DPO. Another concurrent work (Chen et al.,

2024) also consider the length exploitation prob-

lem in the classical RLHF pipeline, suggesting a

similar regularization in the reward modeling stage

in Eq. 2. This regularizer helps disentangle answer

quality from length, demonstrating meaningful im-

provement in length-controlled performance. Our

derivations can be seen as the DPO implicit reward

counterpart to this classical RLHF approach, ex-

plicitly linking the regularized reward modeling

problem to an equivalent regularized RL setup.

Similar to the original DPO formulation, the reg-

ularized objective still aims to increase the likeli-

hood along the preferred answer, while decreasing

ulated by a weighting term. This term is equivalent

to the original DPO formulation with the addition

of the regularization margin α|yw|−α|yl|. We can

interpret this as an additional per-example learn-

ing rate, which up-weighs the gradient on feedback

pairs, in which the selected answer is shorter and

down-weights the gradient on pairs in which the

selected answer is longer, proportional to the dif-

ference in length.

Experiments

In this section we will empirically investigate the

verbosity exploitation issues in DPO, the effective-

ness of our regularization strategy and the potential

causes of these effects. We beging with a descrip-

tion of our evaluation tasks and models.

4.1

Datasets and Models

We utilize three different setups in our experimen-

tal setting based on summarization, dialogue and

general instruction-following.

Summarization We use the standard Reddit

TL;DR (TL;DR) summarization dataset from (Sti-

ennon et al., 2022), which consists of a Reddit post

and several short summaries, judged for quality and

informativeness by human evaluators.

Dialogue: For our dialogue experiment we use

the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (HH) datasets

(Bai et al., 2022b), which consists of general con-

versations with a language model assistants, which

are also ranked by human annotators.

Datasets statistics are included in Table 1 where

exhibit a small length bias in the preferred re-

sponse. Following (Rafailov et al., 2023), we use

the Pythia 2.8B (Biderman et al., 2023) for both

the dialogue and summarization tasks, carrying out

full-parameter fine-tuning using the DPO original

codebase2 with default hyperparameters, except

when noted otherwise. See C for more details.

optimization

4.2

Length Exploitation in DPO and

Effectiveness of Regularization

We first consider the Anthropic Helpful and Harm-

less and Reddit TL;DR datasets. For both tasks,

we train models with three parameter values β ∈

[0.5, 0.1, 0.05] and then sample 256 answers using

prompts from the evaluation dataset. The length

histograms are shown in Fig. 2. The first two

columns show the answer length distribution for

the set of preferred, rejected and DPO-generated

answers, with each row corresponding to a different

β parameter value. We see that the DPO generated

answers are, on average, significantly longer than

both the preferred and rejected answers. Models

trained with smaller values of β generate longer

responses on average, which is expected since β

controls the deviation from the initial policy. Not

only does the DPO model generate longer answers,

it also generates answers that are significantly out-

of-distribution in terms of length from the offline

preference dataset.

The third and fourth column in Fig. 2 show re-

sults for the SFT, DPO the length-regularized DPO

model introduced in Section 3. We use α = 0.01

and α = 0.05 for the Anthropic Helpful and Harm-

less and Reddit TL;DR datasets respectively. While

the length-regularized models still show mild in-

crease in average length, they match the SFT model

much more closely. Moreover, they do not gener-

ate answers with significantly out-of-distribution

lengths.

This indicates that the proposed algo-

rithm can efficiently regularize the verbosity of

the trained model.

4.3

Length Versus Quality Trade-Offs

In this section, we evaluate the length versus qual-

ity model trade-offs. For the Anthropic Helpful

and Harmless and Reddit TL;DR datasets, we use

the answers sampled from DPO policies and com-

pare them head-to-head against the dataset pre-

ferred answer, with GPT-4 as an evaluator. Our

main results are shown in Fig.

3, which plots

winrates. GPT-4-0613 used as judge with prompt similar to (Rafailov et al., 2023), with random position flipping.

model win rates against average answer length,

with 90% confidence intervals. We again evalu-

ate all models with β ∈[0.05, 0.1.0.5]. For HH,

we use α ∈[0, 0.005, 0.01]; for TL;DR, we use

α ∈[0, 0.2, 0.5] (α = 0 is standard DPO). Sim-

ilar to before, we see that the length-regularized

training can efficiently control verbosity, signifi-

cantly decreasing the average length of the answers

as compared to standard DPO. Moreover, on the

HH task, regularization also leads to mild improve-

ment in win rates, but a slight decrease on TL;DR

(although both of these are not statistically signifi-

cant). These results are quite promising, as GPT-4

is known to have a significant length bias in its pref-

erences (Wang et al., 2023; Singhal et al., 2023).

On both HH and TL;DR, the length-regularized

experiments with β = 0.05 and β = 0.01 match

the average lengths of the corresponding β = 0.5

runs, but achieve statistically significant higher cor-

responding win rates, with close to 20% improve-

ment on HH and close to 15% improvement on

## Tl;Dr.

4.4

Is Length a Proxy for KL-Divergence?

In the constrained RL problem in Eq. 3 and the

corresponding DPO objective in Eq. 4, the β pa-

rameter controls the degree of policy divergence

from the initial reference model. In Fig. 2 and

Fig. 3, we see that average length of the model

generated answers is inversely proportional to the

β parameter. In this section, we investigate the

relationship between the length-regularized DPO

objective in Eq. 9 and the KL divergence from the

initial policy. In Fig. 4, we plot the trained policy’s

KL divergence from πref for the different values of

β and α parameters. We see only a weak correla-

tion between KL divergence and length. For both

HH and TL;DR, length-regularized models trained

with β = 0.05 and β = 0.01 match the average

length of train runs with β = 0.5 (Fig. 3). At the

same time, these runs have statistically significant

higher KL divergences and win rates as shown in

Fig. 4. We hypothesize that this indicates the exis-

tence of different factors driving human preference,

with length only partially accounting for the policy

KL divergence.

4.5

DPO and Early Convergence

In (Rafailov et al., 2023), the authors show early

convergence of the DPO algorithm on the HH

dataset. DPO achieves its best performance within

a few hundred gradient steps, and does not improve

with further training. Similar observations have

also been made within the open-source community.

We claim that this effect is likely due to length

exploitation and the biased GPT-4 evaluator. In

Fig. 5, we consider the training progression on the

HH dataset with β = 0.1. We compare the regular

DPO run (α = 0) with the length-regularized one

(α = 0.1). We train for two epochs and evaluate in-

termediate checkpoints on the same set of prompts

for average answer length, win rates, and KL di-

vergence. Within the first 10% of the epoch, the

standard DPO run produces answers almost twice

as long as the SFT model. Standard DPO achieves

its highest win rate here, with only KL divergence

and average length increasing steadily with further

training. In contrast, the length-regularized run

sees little to no intermediate increase in length,

but steady improvement in win rates throughout

training and slow increases in divergence from the

reference policy. Our final regularized checkpoint

outperforms the non-regularized model along all

fronts (KL, winrate, and length) at the end of 2

## Page 7

weakly correlated with winrates and length.

Figure 5: Evolution of HH sample length, winrates, and KL divergence within two epochs of DPO training. Error

bars indicate 90% confidence intervals. The length-regularized model achieves higher final winrates over the regular

DPO model, at less than 40% of the KL budget and almost half the response length. Moreover, the length-regularized

model demonstrates steady improvement throughout training, while standard DPO performance peaks early on tin

the first epoch and does not improve further, indicating it is not able to learn more complex features of the data.

epochs.

We hypothesize that the regular DPO

training quickly increases length, exploiting the

evaluator’s bias, but fails to capture more complex

preference features. On the other hand, the length-

regularized training run is able to disentangle the

verbosity component and fit other, more difficult

quality features over a longer training period.

4.6

What Drives Length Exploitation?

In classical RLHF, excessive model verbosity

(John Schulman et al., 2022) has been well under-

stood as a reward exploitation problem (Gao et al.,

2023; Casper et al., 2023; Lambert and Calandra,

2023), driven by a bias in the feedback datasets

for longer answers. In particular, in the classical

RLHF pipeline from Section 2.1, the reward model

is continuously queried on new data generated by

the model, creating an out-of-distribution (OOD)

robustness issue. These results do not directly trans-

fer to the DPO algorithm, as it does not train a sep-

arate reward model and only uses the offline feed-

back dataset for training. Surprisingly, we find that

the exploding length issue in DPO training is simi-

larly driven by out-of-distribution exploitation. We

consider the DPO algorithm as an implicit reward

training method, as outlined in Section 2.2. We

investigate the behavior of the implicit reward rθ as

defined in Eq. 5. Since the DPO policy πθ is the op-

timal solution to the constrained RL problem in Eq.

3 corresponding to rθ, any exploitation behaviour

from the policy must be driven by the reward func-

tion. In Fig. 6, we evaluate rθ trained with β = 0.1

and different α parameters on the offline feedback

dataset (within its training distribution) and on an-

swers generated by the corresponding DPO policy

(out of distribution). Surprisingly, within distri-

bution, the corresponding implicit reward models

exhibit weak to no length correlation (and even

negative length correlation with strong α regular-

ization). However, they all show significant length

bias out-of-distribution, with length explaining 30-

46% of the reward variance (as measured by the R2

of a linear regression of the implicit DPO reward

on answer length).

## Page 8

(blue) and rejected (red) answers, as well as OOD answers (green) generated from the corresponding policy. The

reward model exhibits little to no length bias in distribution, but significant length correlation outside its training

distribution.

Related Work

In this section we outline relevant work on reward

exploitation in RLHF and the verbosity bias.

Reward Exploitation in RLHF: RLHF reward ex-

ploitation, also known as reward over-optimization,

is a well-known issue (Skalse et al., 2022; Pan et al.,

2022; Casper et al., 2023; Lambert and Calandra,

2023) in which during the reinforcement learning

stage, the expected reward keeps improving, but

the quality of the model begins to degrade after

some point. These effects were confirmed analyti-

cally in controlled experiments (Gao et al., 2023),

as well as empirically in user studies (Dubois et al.,

2024). Increased model verbosity has been explic-

itly linked to this phenomenon (John Schulman

et al., 2022). A number approaches have been

proposed to mitigate this issue, such as penaliz-

ing epistemic uncertainty (Coste et al., 2023; Zhai

et al., 2023; Ahmed et al., 2024) or using mixture

reward models (Moskovitz et al., 2023), but they

do not explicitly target the length issue.

Mitigating Length Biases in RLHF: A number of

works have sought to explicitly address length bi-

ases in RLHF policies. (Ramamurthy et al., 2023)

suggest setting a simple discount factor, which

improves naturalness of the generated language,

(Singhal et al., 2023) carry out an extensive study of

length correlations in classical RLHF and suggest

a number of heuristic-based mitigating approaches.

The closes to our approach are the works of (Shen

et al., 2023) and the concurrent work of (Chen et al.,

2024), which propose to disentangle length-biases

from quality during the reward modeling stage. Our

work can be seen as a DPO equivalent counter-part

to these approaches.

As far as we are aware, this is the first work to

study the length exploitation problem for Direct

Alignment Algorithms such as DPO.

Conclusion

In this work, we study the problem of length ex-

ploitation in the Direct Preference Optimization

(DPO) algorithm, extending its analysis from clas-

sical RLHF to DPO for the first time. On two

standard human feedback datasets, we empirically

show that DPO exhibits significant length hacking

across a range of hyperparameters. We then specif-

ically link this phenomenon to out-of-distribution

bootstrapping.

We derive an analytical length-

regularized version of the DPO algorithm and show

empirically that we can maintain model perfor-

mance, as evaluated by GPT-4 without significant

increases in verbosity, boosting length-corrected

win rates by up to 15-20%. Given the strong length

bias in public feedback datasets and the promi-

nence of DPO in the open source community, we

hypothesize that many open-source models suffer

from similar length-exploitation issues, driving the

observations of Fig. 1. Our results are encouraging,

suggesting that open-source models could match

proprietary ones on automated evaluations on a

length corrected basis as well.

Limitations

Our work addresses the particular issue of length

exploitation in Direct Preference Optimization.

Our regularization objective requires explicit

penalty function (such as length) and may not be

suitable to avoid general exploitation issues along

axes separate from verbosity. Furthermore, we only

study the DPO objective, which might behave dif-

ferently from other direct alignment algorithms,

which use different objective functions. We also

e4valuate our approach on one model size and two

smaller-scale public datasets of human feedback. It

is unclear what the scaling laws of such exploitation

behaviours might be and to what degree they are de-

pendent on model size, capability and data quality

beyond length biases. We believe these questions

are a promising direction for future work.

Ethics Statement

This work focuses on alleviating and empirical ex-

trapolation issues during DPO training, specifically

an increasing verbosity bias. Experiments are ran

on publicly-available data and pre-trained models,

and do not release any new models for public use.

As a result, there should be no ethical concerns.

## A

Phi-2 UltraFeedback Experiments

To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed

length regularization schena, we run a small set of

experiments with the 2.7B Microsoft model Phi-2

(Javaheripi et al., 2023) on the Ultrafeedback bi-

narized dataset3 (Cui et al., 2023). This dataset

consists of 64K prompts, whose completions are

generated by LLMs and then ranked with GPT. The

chosen response is considered to be the highest-

scoring completion, and the rejected prompt is cho-

sen at random from the other 3 responses. We use

the same experimental setup as for the TL;DR/HH

Pythia 2.8B experiments (see Appendix C), and run

1 epoch of supervised fine-tuning on Ultrafeedback

prior to alignment with DPO. We compare α = 0.0

and α = 0.05, using β = 0.1 for both models.

For evaluation, we use the multi-turn MT Bench

harness (Zheng et al., 2023). The results (Table

2) indicate that the length regularization strategy

decreases length, while actually increasing down-

stream performance, though both gains are small.

## B

Additional Out-of-Distribution

Experiments

In Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we provide the rest of the

reward-length correlation experiments across both

TL;DR and HH (see Fig. 6). The results across dif-

ferent α and β parameter values indicate a similar

pattern of out-of-distribution extrapolation along

the length axis.

## C

Experimental Details

We

follow

the

original

## Dpo

codebase

(https://github.com/eric-mitchell/direct-

preference-optimization)

with

default

hyper-

parameters unless otherwise noted (1 epoch

of training, batch size of 128 with 16 gradient

accumulation steps, RMSProp with a learning rate

of 0.5 × 10−6 with linear warm-up for 150 steps).

For the experiments in the main body of the

paper, we used the OpenAI TL;DR dataset (92K

preferred/dispreferred response pairs) (Stiennon

3https://huggingface.co/datasets/

HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized

et al., 2022). Each prompt is a Reddit post be-

longing to one of several topic forums, with ti-

tle/post metadata included. 256 prompts sampled

from the held-out set are used for all evaluations

(e.g. loss, accuracy, KL, winrates, length), with

temperature 1.0 and max length 512. All mod-

els in the main experiments were initialized from

Pythia 2.8B base pre-trained weights, and under-

went supervised fine-tuning on TL;DR for 1 epoch

prior to DPO. All experiments were carried out on

4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs for a total of about 2000

GPU hours. All evaluations were computed with

gpt-4-1106-preview as judge, with random posi-

tional flips to avoid known bias. We use the same

GPT-4 evaluation prompts as in (Rafailov et al.,

2023), they are listed below for completeness.

Sample Responses Across Models

In this section, we provide examples of model

responses generated by length-regularized DPO

(RDPO), standard DPO (DPO), and the initial policy

(SFT), in response to prompts from the HH/TL;DR

evaluation sets.

These examples are selected

to highlight cases where regularized DPO wins

against the dataset response (according to the GPT-

4 evaluator), but both the DPO and SFT-produced

answers do not. All samples were generated with

the standard procedure in Appendix C from the

same set of 256 prompts used for the rest of evalu-

ations. See Tables 3 through 6 for samples.

Prompt

Human: How often should a one year old shower?

Assistant: An important part of daily hygiene is to shower or bathe on a regular

basis. The frequency of bathing or showering depends on the weather and

activity. Children should bathe or shower as needed to keep clean. Generally

children under one year of age don’t need to bathe or shower. When children

are one year old, you should bathe or shower as often as your child’s doctor

recommends. Generally, it’s fine to take your child for a bath or shower as often

as you feel like.

Human: Okay, but too often might strip the oils from their skin.

Assistant:

## Sft

Correct, taking the wrong age appropriate number of baths or showers can

cause the oil layer to thin or disappear. Generally speaking, it’s best to bathe or

shower your child for a healthy clean skin. You might need to bathe or shower

your child after using soap or other cleansing products.

## Dpo

You’re correct! Ideally, a child should bathe or shower only when they need to,

but there are some occasions when parents may want to take a more frequent

approach to washing their child. For example, a child under one year old might

benefit from being bathed or showered more frequently if their skin is oily or

if they have a common skin irritant or infection. As a general rule, it’s best to

take a more frequent approach to bathing or showering your child when they

are young, rather than a more infrequent one. You should still only bathe or

shower as often as your child’s doctor recommends. For your child’s health and

wellbeing, you should be as careful and responsible about bathing or showering

as possible.

## Rdpo

You’re right, taking a child for a bath too often can strip the child’s skin of its

oils. Bathing too frequently can also cause skin irritation and rashes, so try to

get your child into the shower or bath only as needed.

Prompt

Human: Should you rent a Uhaul to move?

Assistant: Do you need to transport very large, heavy items?

Human: Yes like couches and beds.

Assistant: I would probably recommend a Uhaul.

Human: Can anyone drive one of them?

Assistant:

## Sft

No.

## Dpo

Well yes and no. It’s not easy, but you might be able to rent one from your gas

station or auto parts store, or you could buy the driver’s manual for one from

Amazon for around $60, and you can always learn if you don’t feel confident

enough. The main challenge is that you’ll need to be very sure that you’re fully

competent before driving one. You might also consider renting one, because

it’s also better for the environment because it’s more efficient. So for example,

if you need to transport two couches instead of one, it will take you two trips

instead of one. And there’s less plastic packaging in the world, so that’s good

for the environment.

## Rdpo

Renting a Uhaul from an authorized rental company requires a driver’s license

and a minimum of 2.5 years of driving experience. So no, it’s not possible to

rent one without having a driver’s license and 2.5 years of driving experience.

SUBREDDIT: r/relationships

TITLE: Me[25M] with my EX GF [18F] 2 years, We broke up because I flirted

with another girl.

POST: # Part 1

I’m finding it hard to understand something. My ex GF broke up with me 6

months ago, I tried winning her back for 6 months. We would see each other

once every 2 weeks and we’d get on like 2 peas in a pod and she kept leading

me on, however 2 days after seeing her she would tell me it was a mistake and

that we can’t speak anymore. This of course was really unfair and caused me

great depression.

# Part 2

After dealing with this for 6 months I decided to completely cut her out, and

I’ve been doing good by not messaging her anymore. She still messages me

almost every 2nd night. I don’t get it.. She doesn’t want anything to do with me

however she still messages me. Surely if someone wanted to cut someone out

of their life they wouldn’t go through all the trouble of constantly messaging

someone?

# Part 3

I guess what I’m trying to get at is, does anyone have an explanation as to why

someone who broke up with me keeps messaging me even after I said goodbye

for good?

Thanks

## Sft

## Dpo

in advance

Me (24f) and ex GF of 6 months (29f) broke up 6 months ago. She still messes

me up when I tell her we can never speak again and I’ve been deleting all her

text messages and emails. Why does she still message me?

## Rdpo

SO confused on why GF keeps messaging after saying she doesn’t want any-

thing to do with me beyond the odd text.

SUBREDDIT: r/relationships

TITLE: Me [40 F] with my husband [40 M] . . . we have been married 17

years. He has absolutely no interest in going out on date nights, not even for

our anniversary or for my birthday.

POST: I’m just hurting inside. Number one, he doesn’t want to spend time with

me without the kids. Number two, it doesn’t matter to him at all that I would

like some time without the kids. You’d think that even if he didn’t want to go

out, he’d do it at least once a year for me, you know?

We moved here, 400 miles away from my family, so he could take his dream job.

Between work and school he is often gone 80 hours a week. One of our children

is special needs with sensory processing disorder and anxiety/depression. I do

most of the parenting while trying to run a freelance business on the side.

My family would often help with the kids but without the family support and

with him being gone it’s so hard. And he won’t compromise. He just doesn’t

ever want to go out on date nights. He’ll happily go to a baseball game for work

or go out golfing with his buddies, but he’ll never do anything for me. And I

get really sad that he doesn’t seem to crave any alone time with me.

Am I being unreasonable to want to get out on a date night? What should I do?

## Sft

my husband takes forever to get to date night and never wants to spend time

with me.

## Dpo

My boyfriend of two years isn’t interested in me spending time on a date night

with him. Instead, I’ve found him working long hours with his dream job and I

am alone all the time. I feel like I am dying inside because we used to go out

regularly and now he doesn’t seem to even want that type of relationship. I just

feel unloved by this man and I need some answers. BF of two years has chosen

to pursue some crazy dream job instead of spending time with me on a regular

basis. I am lonely and unhappy. I need some clarity on what I can do about this

issue.

## Rdpo

My husband seems to take very little time out for me and I feel neglected. He

rarely devotes time for date night and I feel deprived and lonely. I want him to

be more invested in our relationship.
