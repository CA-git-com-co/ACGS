# LaTeX Setup Guide for ACGS Research Papers
# Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up LaTeX and all required packages for compiling ACGS research papers. The setup includes both LaTeX packages and Python dependencies for document processing and figure generation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install LaTeX packages
./install_latex_packages.sh

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r python_latex_requirements.txt

# 3. Test compilation
cd arxiv_submission_package
make
```

## Prerequisites

### LaTeX Distribution

You need either **TeX Live** (recommended) or **MiKTeX** installed:

#### TeX Live (Linux/macOS/Windows)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install texlive-full

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install --cask mactex

# Or download from: https://www.tug.org/texlive/
```

#### MiKTeX (Windows/Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Download from: https://miktex.org/download
```

### Python Environment

Python 3.8+ with pip:
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

Run the automated installation script:
```bash
chmod +x install_latex_packages.sh
./install_latex_packages.sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your LaTeX distribution
- Update package databases
- Install all required LaTeX packages
- Install Python dependencies
- Verify the installation

### Method 2: Manual Installation

#### LaTeX Packages

For **TeX Live**:
```bash
# Update package database
tlmgr update --self --all

# Install core packages
tlmgr install acmart amsmath amsfonts amssymb booktabs algorithm2e
tlmgr install graphicx tikz pgfplots hyperref natbib cleveref
tlmgr install listings minted subcaption float xcolor

# Install all packages from requirements
cat latex_requirements.txt | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^$' | xargs tlmgr install
```

For **MiKTeX**:
```bash
# Update packages
miktex packages update

# Install packages
miktex packages install acmart amsmath amsfonts amssymb booktabs
# ... (continue with other packages)
```

#### Python Packages

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r python_latex_requirements.txt

# For development/testing
pip install -r arxiv_submission_package/requirements-test.txt
```

## Performance Requirements

### ACGS-2 Performance Targets
- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)  
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection via Prometheus
- Automated alerting on threshold violations
- Continuous validation of constitutional compliance
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD

### Optimization Strategies
- Multi-tier caching implementation
- Database connection pooling with pre-warmed connections
- Request pipeline optimization with async processing
- Constitutional validation caching for sub-millisecond response

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.

## Compilation Instructions

### ACGS-PGP Paper

```bash
cd docs/research/arxiv_submission_package

# Method 1: Using Makefile
make

# Method 2: Using Python compiler
python compiler.py

# Method 3: Manual compilation
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

### Other Research Papers

```bash
cd docs/research/arXiv-2506.16507v1

# Compile with pdflatex
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Packages
```bash
# Error: "File 'package.sty' not found"
# Solution: Install the missing package
tlmgr install package-name
```

#### Font Issues
```bash
# Error: Font warnings or missing characters
# Solution: Update font packages
tlmgr install lmodern fontspec unicode-math
```

#### Bibliography Issues
```bash
# Error: Bibliography not appearing
# Solution: Run bibtex/biber
bibtex main  # for natbib
biber main   # for biblatex
```

#### Python Package Issues
```bash
# Error: Module not found
# Solution: Install missing Python package
pip install package-name

# For system-wide installation
sudo pip install package-name
```

### Verification

Test your installation:
```bash
# Test LaTeX compilation
cd /tmp
cat > test.tex << 'EOF'
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath,graphicx,booktabs}
\begin{document}
\title{Test Document}
\maketitle
Test: $E = mc^2$
\end{document}
EOF

pdflatex test.tex
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Package Installation

For packages not in standard repositories:
```bash
# Download .sty file to local texmf tree
mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex/custom
cp custom-package.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/custom/
texhash ~/texmf
```

### Performance Optimization

For faster compilation:
```bash
# Use lualatex for complex documents
lualatex main.tex

# Use latexmk for automatic compilation
latexmk -pdf main.tex

# Parallel compilation
latexmk -pdf -pvc main.tex  # continuous preview
```

### Integration with Editors

#### VS Code
Install extensions:
- LaTeX Workshop
- LaTeX Utilities

#### Vim/Neovim
Install plugins:
- vimtex
- coc-texlab

#### Emacs
Use AUCTeX package
