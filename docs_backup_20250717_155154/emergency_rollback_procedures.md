## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the emergency rollback procedures for the ACGS platform. These procedures are designed to be executed in the event of a critical failure, such as a constitutional compliance failure, a major security breach, or a complete system outage. The primary objective of these procedures is to restore the system to a known-good state as quickly as possible, with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 30 minutes.

## 2. Rollback Strategy

The ACGS platform uses a blue-green deployment strategy, which allows for near-instantaneous rollbacks. In the event of a critical failure, the following steps will be taken to roll back the system:

1.  **Identify the Failure:** The first step is to identify the nature and scope of the failure. This will be done by reviewing the system logs, monitoring dashboards, and any available error reports.
2.  **Switch to the Blue Environment:** Once the failure has been identified, the traffic will be switched from the green (active) environment to the blue (standby) environment. This will be done by updating the traffic routing configuration.
3.  **Validate the Blue Environment:** After switching the traffic, the blue environment will be thoroughly validated to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
4.  **Investigate the Failure:** While the blue environment is serving traffic, the green environment will be taken offline for a thorough investigation of the failure.
5.  **Remediate the Failure:** Once the root cause of the failure has been identified, a fix will be developed and deployed to the green environment.
6.  **Switch Back to the Green Environment:** After the fix has been deployed and validated, the traffic will be switched back to the green environment.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

The following roles and responsibilities have been defined for the emergency rollback process:

- **Incident Commander:** The Incident Commander is responsible for overseeing the entire rollback process and making key decisions.
- **Technical Lead:** The Technical Lead is responsible for the technical execution of the rollback procedures.
- **Communications Lead:** The Communications Lead is responsible for communicating with stakeholders during the rollback process.

## 4. Conclusion

These emergency rollback procedures provide a clear and concise plan for restoring the ACGS platform in the event of a critical failure. By following these procedures, we can minimize the impact of any potential failures and ensure the continued availability and integrity of the system.

## Performance Requirements

### ACGS-2 Performance Targets
- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)  
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection via Prometheus
- Automated alerting on threshold violations
- Continuous validation of constitutional compliance
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD

### Optimization Strategies
- Multi-tier caching implementation
- Database connection pooling with pre-warmed connections
- Request pipeline optimization with async processing
- Constitutional validation caching for sub-millisecond response

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
