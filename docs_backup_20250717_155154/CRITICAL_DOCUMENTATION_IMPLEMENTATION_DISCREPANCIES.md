-----|
| **PostgreSQL** | 5439 | 5439 (docker-compose.postgresql.yml) | ✅ **CORRECT** |
| **Redis** | 6389 | 6389 (docker-compose.redis.yml) | ✅ **CORRECT** |

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### ✅ ISSUES RESOLVED

1. **Port Configuration Consistency**:
   - ✅ All infrastructure ports now match documentation (5439, 6389, 8016)
   - ✅ Main infrastructure file updated to use correct production ports
   - ✅ Deployment consistency restored

2. **Service Integration Fixed**:
   - ✅ All services now reference Auth Service on correct port 8016
   - ✅ Database connections configured for port 5439 (external)
   - ✅ Cache connections configured for port 6389 (external)

3. **Constitutional Compliance Maintained**:
   - ✅ Constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` preserved in all configurations
   - ✅ Service discovery and health checks will work correctly

## ✅ Actions Completed

### 1. Infrastructure Docker Compose File Fixed

**File**: `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.acgs.yml`

**Changes Applied**:

```yaml
# PostgreSQL - Updated to production port
ports:
  - '5439:5432'  # External:Internal ✅

# Redis - Updated to production port
ports:
  - '6389:6379'  # External:Internal ✅

# Auth Service - Updated to production port
ports:
  - '8016:8016'  # External:Internal ✅
environment:
  - SERVICE_PORT=8016 ✅
command: ['uvicorn', 'app.main:app', '--host', '0.0.0.0', '--port', '8016'] ✅
```

### 2. Service Environment Variables Updated

**All AUTH_SERVICE_URL references updated**:

```yaml
# All services now correctly reference:
AUTH_SERVICE_URL: http://auth_service:8016 ✅
# Updated in: AC, Integrity, FV, GS, PGC, EC services
```

**Database and Redis URLs remain correct**:

```yaml
DATABASE_URL: postgresql+asyncpg://acgs_user:acgs_password@postgres:5432/acgs_db
# Note: Internal container port remains 5432, external is 5439 ✅

REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/0
# Note: Internal container port remains 6379, external is 6389 ✅
```

### 3. Constitutional Hash Consistency Verified

✅ **CONFIRMED**: Constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` is correctly present in:

- Auth service environment variables
- All documentation files
- Configuration files

## 📋 Validation Checklist

### Configuration Changes Completed

- [x] Fix port configurations in infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.acgs.yml
- [x] Update service port environment variables
- [x] Update all AUTH_SERVICE_URL references
- [x] Confirm constitutional hash validation

### Deployment Testing Required

- [ ] Test all service connections
- [ ] Verify health check endpoints
- [ ] Test PostgreSQL connection on port 5439
- [ ] Test Redis connection on port 6389
- [ ] Test Auth Service on port 8016
- [ ] Verify all service integrations
- [ ] Run full health check suite

## 🎯 Success Criteria

1. **Port Consistency**: All services use documented production ports
2. **Service Integration**: All inter-service connections work correctly
3. **Health Checks**: All `/health` endpoints respond correctly
4. **Constitutional Compliance**: Hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` validated across all services
5. **Documentation Accuracy**: Implementation matches documentation exactly

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix infrastructure docker-compose.acgs.yml port configurations
2. **URGENT**: Test deployment with corrected configurations
3. **CRITICAL**: Update any dependent service configurations
4. **IMPORTANT**: Validate all service integrations work correctly
5. **ESSENTIAL**: Update documentation if any additional discrepancies found
