# ACGS Risk-Assessed Migration Plan

<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->


**Date:** 2025-06-26

**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the risk-assessed migration plan for transitioning the ACGS platform from its current 7-service architecture to the 8-service enterprise architecture specified in `GEMINI.md`. The plan is divided into four phases, each with specific objectives, deliverables, and a risk assessment based on a 4-tier priority system.

## 2. Risk Assessment Framework

The following 4-tier priority system will be used to classify risks and determine the response time for mitigation:

- **Critical (P1):** Issues that could cause a complete system outage, data loss, or a major security breach. **Response Time: 2 hours.**
- **High (P2):** Issues that could cause a significant degradation of service, a partial system outage, or a potential security vulnerability. **Response Time: 24-48 hours.**
- **Moderate (P3):** Issues that could cause a minor degradation of service or have a limited impact on system functionality. **Response Time: 1 week.**
- **Low (P4):** Issues that have a minimal impact on the system and can be addressed in a planned maintenance window. **Response Time: 2 weeks.**

## 3. Phased Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Weeks 5-8)

**Objectives:**

- Deploy the foundational infrastructure for the new enterprise architecture with zero downtime.
- Establish the Linkerd service mesh and migrate from Redis to DragonflyDB.
- Deploy the new `Model Orchestrator` service.

**Tasks & Priorities:**

| Task                              | Priority | Risk Assessment -                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy Linkerd Service Mesh       | P1       | **Risk:** Misconfiguration could lead to service communication failures. <br> **Mitigation:** Deploy in a staging environment first, and use Linkerd's built-in validation tools. - |
| Migrate Redis to DragonflyDB      | P2       | **Risk:** Data loss during migration. <br> **Mitigation:** Use a dual-write strategy during the migration period to ensure data consistency. -                                      |
| Deploy Model Orchestrator Service | P2       | **Risk:** The new service may not be stable. <br> **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test the service in a staging environment before deploying to production. -                            |

### Phase 2: Service Expansion (Weeks 9-12)

**Objectives:**

- Expand the existing 7 services to the proposed 8-service architecture.
- Implement blue-green deployments for all services.

**Tasks & Priorities:**

| Task                              | Priority | Risk Assessment -                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Refactor Services for Port Ranges | P2       | **Risk:** Services may not be designed for horizontal scaling. <br> **Mitigation:** Refactor services to be stateless and use a shared data store for session management. -                     |
| Implement Blue-Green Deployments  | P1       | **Risk:** A failed deployment could result in downtime. <br> **Mitigation:** Use a canary deployment strategy to gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users before a full rollout. - |

### Phase 3: AI Model Integration & Performance Optimization (Weeks 13-16)

**Objectives:**

- Integrate the new AI models specified in `GEMINI.md`.
- Optimize the performance of all services to meet the new performance targets.

**Tasks & Priorities:**

| Task                         | Priority | Risk Assessment -                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integrate New AI Models      | P1       | **Risk:** The new models may not be compatible with the existing code. <br> **Mitigation:** Develop a new AI model abstraction layer to isolate the services from the specific model implementations. - |
| Optimize Service Performance | P1       | **Risk:** Performance optimizations may introduce new bugs. <br> **Mitigation:** Use a combination of load testing, profiling, and code reviews to identify and address performance bottlenecks. -      |

### Phase 4: Security Hardening & Enterprise Readiness (Weeks 17-20)

**Objectives:**

- Implement the advanced security features specified in `GEMINI.md`.
- Validate the enterprise readiness of the new architecture.

**Tasks & Priorities:**

| Task                                | Priority | Risk Assessment -                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Implement Post-Quantum Cryptography | P1       | **Risk:** The new cryptographic algorithms may not be implemented correctly. <br> **Mitigation:** Use well-tested and audited libraries, and conduct a third-party security audit. -                               |
| Validate Enterprise Readiness       | P2       | **Risk:** The new architecture may not meet all the enterprise readiness criteria. <br> **Mitigation:** Conduct a thorough review of the architecture against the enterprise readiness checklist in `GEMINI.md`. - |
