# ACGS Performance Benchmarking Plan

<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->


**Date:** 2025-02-20

**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the performance benchmarking plan for the ACGS platform migration. The plan defines the performance targets, the benchmarking methodology, and the tools that will be used to measure and validate the performance of the system at each phase of the migration.

## 2. Performance Targets

The following performance targets are based on the `GEMINI.md` specification and will be used to measure the success of the migration:

### 2.1. High-Level Targets

- **Throughput:** 15,000+ RPS
- **Latency:** <50ms (p50), <400ms (p99)
- **Availability:** 99.99%
- **Constitutional Compliance Score:** >98.5%
- **Cost per Request:** <$0.0012

### 2.2. Intermediate Targets

To ensure a gradual and measurable improvement in performance, the following intermediate targets will be used at each phase of the migration:

| Phase                                        | Throughput (RPS) | Latency (p95) | Availability | Constitutional Compliance | Cost per Request |
|

## 3. Benchmarking Methodology

The following methodology will be used to benchmark the performance of the ACGS platform:

1.  **Baseline Measurement:** Before each phase of the migration, a baseline performance measurement will be taken to capture the current performance of the system.
2.  **Load Testing:** A series of load tests will be conducted to measure the performance of the system under different workloads. The load tests will simulate a realistic user workload, including a mix of read and write operations.
3.  **Performance Analysis:** The results of the load tests will be analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
4.  **Optimization:** The system will be optimized to address the identified performance bottlenecks.
5.  **Final Measurement:** After each phase of the migration, a final performance measurement will be taken to validate the performance improvements.

## 4. Benchmarking Tools

The following tools will be used for performance benchmarking:

- **Load Testing:** [k6](https://k6.io/) will be used for load testing. k6 is a modern, open-source load testing tool that is easy to use and provides detailed performance metrics.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana will be used for monitoring the performance of the system. Prometheus will be used to collect performance metrics, and Grafana will be used to visualize the metrics in real-time.
- **Profiling:** [py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) will be used for profiling the Python services to identify performance bottlenecks in the code.

## 5. Conclusion

This performance benchmarking plan provides a clear roadmap for measuring and validating the performance of the ACGS platform during the migration. By following this plan, we can ensure that the new enterprise architecture meets the performance targets defined in the `GEMINI.md` specification.
