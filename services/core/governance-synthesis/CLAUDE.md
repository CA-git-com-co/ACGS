# Governance Synthesis Service Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The Governance Synthesis Service is a critical component of ACGS-2's constitutional governance framework, operating on port 8004. This service provides advanced policy synthesis, OPA (Open Policy Agent) integration, and WASM-based policy compilation for real-time governance decisions. It implements sophisticated policy orchestration with P99 latency <5ms and >100 RPS throughput while maintaining constitutional compliance.

The service serves as the policy synthesis engine for ACGS-2, transforming constitutional principles into executable policies through advanced AI model integration and formal policy compilation.
