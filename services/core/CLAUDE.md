# ACGS-2 Core Services Directory Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The `services/core` directory contains the foundational microservices that implement the core constitutional AI governance capabilities of ACGS-2. These services form the constitutional layer of the system, providing constitutional compliance validation, formal verification, policy synthesis, and multi-agent coordination. Each service operates as an independent microservice with dedicated ports, implementing FastAPI + Pydantic v2 patterns with async/await throughout.

This directory represents the heart of the ACGS-2 constitutional governance framework, where constitutional principles are enforced, policies are synthesized, and formal verification ensures mathematical correctness of governance decisions.
