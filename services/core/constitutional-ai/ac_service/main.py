Constitutional AI Service - Main Entry Point
Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2

This is the main entry point for the Constitutional AI service.
The actual application logic is implemented in the app/ directory
using a modular, refactored architecture.

Key Features:
- Constitutional compliance validation with hash verification
- Cache optimization for 85% hit rate target
- Service discovery and health monitoring
- Comprehensive API endpoints for governance operations
- Integration with ACGS shared services

Performance Targets:
- P99 Latency: <5ms for constitutional operations
- Throughput: >1000 RPS with constitutional compliance
- Cache Hit Rate: >85% for constitutional data
- Availability: 99.99% uptime with monitoring
