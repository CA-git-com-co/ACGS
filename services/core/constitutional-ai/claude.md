# Constitutional AI Service Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The Constitutional AI Service is the cornerstone of ACGS-2's constitutional governance framework, operating on port 8001. This service provides real-time constitutional compliance validation, democratic principle sourcing, and hybrid RLHF + Constitutional AI governance. It implements Anthropic's Collective Constitutional AI methodology for bias reduction and democratic legitimacy while maintaining production-ready performance with P99 latency <5ms and >1000 RPS throughput.

The service serves as the primary constitutional authority for all ACGS-2 operations, ensuring that every governance decision adheres to established constitutional principles through advanced AI model integration and formal verification.
