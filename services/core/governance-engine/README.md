# Unified Governance Engine Service
**Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2**


**Constitutional Hash**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`

## Overview

The Unified Governance Engine combines the functionality of:
- **Governance Synthesis Service** (formerly gs_service, port 8004)
- **Policy Governance & Compliance Service** (formerly pgc_service, port 8005)

This consolidation reduces service sprawl while maintaining all core functionality.

## Features

### Governance Synthesis (from gs_service)
- Policy synthesis using OPA engine
- Multi-model coordination and consensus
- Constitutional compliance validation
- Performance optimization and caching
- LLM integration for policy generation

### Policy Governance & Compliance (from pgc_service)
- Policy enforcement and compliance checking
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Incremental policy compilation
- Quantum-enhanced policy enforcement
- Ultra-low latency optimization

## Port Assignment

- **Port 8004**: Unified Governance Engine (replaces both 8004 and 8005)

## Migration

This service replaces:
- `services/core/governance-synthesis/` (port 8004)
- `services/core/policy-governance/` (port 8005)

All existing APIs are preserved with backward compatibility.

## Implementation Status

- âœ… **Constitutional Hash Validation**: Active enforcement of `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- ðŸ”„ **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of targets
- âœ… **Documentation Standards**: Compliant with ACGS-2 requirements
- ðŸ”„ **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ongoing link integrity maintenance

**Overall Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement implementation

## Performance Targets

This component maintains the following performance requirements:

- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
