**Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2**


**Constitutional Hash**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`

## Overview

The Constitutional Core Service unifies constitutional AI and formal verification capabilities into a single, powerful service. This consolidation reduces service sprawl while providing comprehensive constitutional compliance and formal verification.

## Features

### Constitutional AI (from ac_service)
- Constitutional principle validation and enforcement
- AI-based constitutional reasoning and interpretation
- Constitutional amendment lifecycle management
- Stakeholder engagement and democratic governance
- Human-in-the-loop constitutional decision making
- Multi-model constitutional consensus
- Constitutional reward modeling

### Formal Verification (from fv_service)
- Z3 SMT solver integration for mathematical proofs
- Formal specification validation
- Policy compliance verification
- Cryptographic signature validation
- Proof obligation generation and verification
- Cross-domain testing and validation
- Adversarial robustness testing

### Unified Capabilities
- Constitutional compliance scoring with formal mathematical backing
- Formal verification of constitutional principles
- Mathematically proven constitutional compliance
- Integrated audit trails with cryptographic integrity
- Constitutional-aware formal specifications

## Port Assignment

- **Port 8001**: Constitutional Core Service (replaces both 8001 and 8003)

## Migration

This service replaces:
- `services/core/constitutional-ai/` (port 8001)
- `services/core/formal-verification/` (port 8003)

All existing APIs are preserved with backward compatibility.

## Key Benefits

1. **Unified Constitutional Reasoning**: Combines AI reasoning with mathematical proofs
2. **Formal Constitutional Verification**: Mathematical proof of constitutional compliance
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Single service for all constitutional and verification needs
4. **Enhanced Accuracy**: Cross-validation between AI and formal methods
5. **Better Performance**: Direct integration eliminates network overhead

## Implementation Status

- âœ… **Constitutional Hash Validation**: Active enforcement of `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- ðŸ”„ **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of targets
- âœ… **Documentation Standards**: Compliant with ACGS-2 requirements
- ðŸ”„ **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ongoing link integrity maintenance

**Overall Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement implementation

## Performance Targets

This component maintains the following performance requirements:

- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
