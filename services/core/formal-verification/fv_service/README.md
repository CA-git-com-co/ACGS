# ACGS-1 Enhanced Formal Verification Service

## Overview

The Enhanced Formal Verification (FV) Service is a critical component of the ACGS-1 system, providing enterprise-grade formal verification capabilities. It integrates with the Z3 SMT solver to mathematically prove the correctness of policies and system behaviors. The service also includes cryptographic signature validation and a blockchain-based audit trail to ensure the integrity and auditability of all verification activities.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Mathematical Proof Algorithms:** The service integrates with the Z3 SMT solver to provide advanced mathematical proof capabilities for complex logical constraints.
- **Cryptographic Signature Validation:** The service provides a complete cryptographic validation pipeline, including support for RSA and ECDSA digital signatures, SHA-256 hash verification, and Merkle proofs.
- **Blockchain-based Audit Trail:** The service maintains an immutable audit trail of all verification activities using a cryptographic hash chain.
- **AC Service Integration:** The service integrates with the Constitutional AI (AC) service to provide real-time validation against constitutional principles.
- **Performance Optimization:** The service is optimized for enterprise workloads, with support for parallel processing, caching, and load balancing.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The service includes detailed error classification, automatic retry mechanisms, and graceful error recovery.
