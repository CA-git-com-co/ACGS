# Formal Verification Service Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The Formal Verification Service operates on port 8003 as a critical component of ACGS-2's constitutional governance framework. This service provides enterprise-grade formal verification capabilities with mathematical proof generation, integrating with the Z3 SMT solver to mathematically prove the correctness of policies and system behaviors. It ensures constitutional compliance through formal methods, delivering mathematical certainty for governance decisions with P99 latency targeting <5ms.

The service bridges the gap between constitutional principles and mathematical rigor, providing formal proofs that governance policies and system behaviors adhere to constitutional requirements through advanced theorem proving and SMT solving.
