# ACGS-2 Platform Services Directory Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The `services/platform_services` directory contains the foundational platform infrastructure services that provide security, routing, integrity, and coordination capabilities for the ACGS-2 ecosystem. These services form the platform layer that enables secure, scalable, and auditable operations across all constitutional AI governance services. Each service implements enterprise-grade security patterns with JWT authentication, multi-tenant isolation, and comprehensive audit trails.

This directory represents the infrastructure backbone of ACGS-2, providing essential platform capabilities including authentication, API gateway routing, cryptographic integrity verification, audit aggregation, and inter-service coordination through blackboard patterns.
