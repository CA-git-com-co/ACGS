Enhanced Explainability Framework

Industry-standard explainability implementation using SHAP and LIME,
addressing the ACGE technical validation recommendations for replacing
experimental explainability approaches with proven solutions.

Key Components:
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) integration
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) integration
- Hybrid explainability framework
- Production-ready explanation caching and optimization
