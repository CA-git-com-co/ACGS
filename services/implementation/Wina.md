Abstract

The growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs) make efficient inference and activation strategies increasingly critical. While recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), leverage selective activation but require specialized training, training-free sparse activation methods offer broader applicability and superior resource efficiency through their plug-and-play design. However, many existing methods rely solely on hidden state magnitudes to determine activation, resulting in high approximation errors and suboptimal inference accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation), a novel, simple, and training-free sparse activation framework that jointly considers hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise ℓ2-norms of weight matrices. We show that this leads to a sparsification strategy that obtains optimal approximation error bounds with theoretical guarantees tighter than existing techniques. Empirically, WINA also outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., TEAL) by up to 2.94% in average performance at the same sparsity levels, across a diverse set of LLM architectures and datasets. These results position WINA as a new performance frontier for training-free sparse activation in LLM inference, advancing training-free sparse activation methods and setting a robust baseline for efficient inference. The source code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/wina.
1 Introduction

While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, offering unprecedented capabilities in a variety of applications, such as text generation (Li et al., 2024, Cheng et al., 2025), translation (Hendy et al., 2023, sea, 2025), understanding (Chang et al., 2024, Tschannen et al., 2025), and grounding (Zhao et al., 2025, Hui et al., 2025) their growing size and complexity make controlling their computation costs challenging. They often require substantial computational resources, particularly during inference, making reducing inference costs without degrading output quality a central challenge.

One strategy has been to activate only a sub-network of the full model (Jacobs et al., 1991) during inference using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has already seen adoption in popular and widely-used LLMs like GPT4 (Achiam et al., 2023) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023). Other methods include model distillation, where a smaller model is trained using knowledge distilled from a larger teacher model to route inference requests more efficiently. However, these approaches can require a considerable amount of training, which can also be computationally costly.

An alternative is training-free sparse activation, which retains the original dense model but selectively omits weights or neurons at inference time. These training-free methods avoid training or retraining and can be applied to off-the-shelf models. They leverage criteria such as hidden-state magnitudes, weight importance, weight statistics, or additional validation data to determine which parts of the model to deactivate, thereby accelerating inference.

However, current training-free methods exhibit critical limitations. Most notably, they ignore the influence of weight matrices on error propagation. Specifically, these approaches fail to account for how interactions between input elements and the weight matrix during forward propagation affect model outputs, leading to accumulated approximation errors in sparse activation.
Contributions.

In this paper, we propose WINA: a simple, easy-to-use, training-free framework that performs sparse activation based on the magnitude of hidden states and the column-wise ℓ2-norm of the weight matrix. By combining activation strength with weight importance, our thresholds directly reflect how much each activation can influence the next layer. This design provides theoretical guarantees that the total approximation error remains bounded and is lower than that of other comparable approaches.

In contrast, methods like TEAL rely exclusively on the distribution of hidden‐state magnitudes to decide which activations to keep and which to deactivate. Ignoring weight magnitudes in this way may discard highly influential activations or retain many low‐impact ones, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between efficiency and output quality. Our framework overcomes these limitations by integrating weight statistics into the selection process, achieving finer control over sparsity and tighter bounds on the resulting approximation error.

We evaluate WINA on multiple widely-used LLMs (ranging from 7B to 14B parameters) across several popular benchmark datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art training-free methods such as TEAL (Liu et al., 2024) and CATS (Lee et al., 2024), achieves superior model performance at identical sparsity levels, with significantly less performance degradation. We also establish theoretical error bounds for our methodology, providing formal support for the experimental results and validating our method’s effectiveness. In summary, our detailed contributions include as follows.

    •

    Weighted-informed Activation: we introduce a novel sparse activation method that jointly considers hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise ℓ2-norms of weight matrices. This allows for selecting neurons that are not only strongly activated but also those that have a larger influence on downstream layers, leading to a more informed construction of a sub-network during inference.
    •

    Theoretically Tighter Approximation Error: we conduct a formal analysis to demonstrate that our weight-informed activation mechanism yields a lower expected output error compared to prior methods (e.g., TEAL) under mild assumptions, including column-wise orthogonality of weights and monotonic activation functions, with guarantees extendable to multi-layer architectures.
    •

    Numerical Experiments: we perform extensive evaluations on multiple LLMs, including Qwen-2.5 (Bai et al., 2023), LLaMA series (Touvron et al., 2023), and Phi-4 (Abdin et al., 2024), demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy under various sparsity levels. In particular, WINA maintains better performance as sparsity increases, highlighting its robustness and practical utility across diverse tasks and model scales.

The rest of our paper is organized as follows. We begin by reviewing related works in Section 2. We detail our methodology in Section 3 and review our experimental results in Section 4. We conclude with a discussion on future directions in Section 5.
2 Related Work
Sparse Activation.

Modern sparse activation activation approaches fall into two principal paradigms: training-based methods and training-free methods. Training-based methods typically employ a trainable router to learn to dynamically select activated experts for each token, with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture (Jacobs et al., 1991) serving as the foundational framework. In this framework, each expert operates an individual component of the model, as only the relevant experts are activated for each input during inference, achieving significant computational savings.

This paradigm has been expanded through many iterations and variants. The sparsely-gated mixture of experts layer (Shazeer et al., 2017) integrates MoE into recurring neural networks (RNNs). Works like GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2020) and the Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2022) extend MoEs to the Transformer architecture (Raffel et al., 2020) while others combine several approaches, such as WideNet (Xue et al., 2022), reduces the size of the MoE model by initially compressing the model before transitioning into a MoE. Works like MoEBert (Zuo et al., 2022) decomposes the FFN layer of a pre-trained dense model into multiple experts based on importance-guided adaptation and then refines the model through distillation. LLM in Flash (Alizadeh et al., 2023) employs a low-rank predictor to determine which intermediate neurons are activated.

Training-free methods, in contrast, do not rely on a learnable router, instead using predefined or calculated criteria to perform sparse activation. Methods (Han et al., 2015b) can utilize magnitude-based weight pruning or global activation pruning (Wen et al., 2016b) to apply a fixed sparsity pattern regardless of input. For instance, Q-Sparse (Wang et al., 2024) produces sparsity as a function of input magnitudes, achieving sparsity rates of 60% with reasonable performance degradation. CATS (Lee et al., 2024) applies sparse activation on SwiGLU outputs within gated MLP layers, achieving performance comparable to the original dense model while achieving 25% model sparsity. In contrast, TEAL (Liu et al., 2024) extends magnitude-based activation sparsity to all network layers, achieving 40-50% model-wide sparsity across architectures with minimal performance impact.

However, current sparse activation methods suffer from noticeable limitations. They determine activation elements solely based on the magnitude of hidden states, neglecting the crucial influence of the weight matrix, which results in suboptimal error control.
Relations to Model Structured Pruning.

Although WINA shares the shared goal of reducing inference cost with structured pruning methods (via a similar paradigm by searching a sub-network), its philosophy and mechanism differ substantially. Traditional model pruning removes redundant parameters from deep neural networks (Han et al., 2015a, Frankle and Carbin, 2018, Frantar and Alistarh, 2023), often requiring fine-tuning to restore performance (Lin et al., 2019, He et al., 2018, Wen et al., 2016a, Li et al., 2020, Zhuang et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2017, 2021a, 2020). To enhance the quality of the pruned sub-networks, recent advances introduce knowledge-transfer mechanisms during pruning (Chen et al., 2021b, 2023c, 2023b, 2023a, 2024, Qu et al., 2025) or apply post-hoc distillation (Ko et al., 2024, 2025) to improve accuracy. However, these approaches typically involve additional training stages, making them less suitable for scaling to large foundation models. In contrast, WINA is a training-free, plug-and-play sparse activation framework that dynamically selects high-performing sub-networks at inference time without modifying or retraining the model. This makes WINA particularly well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments.
3 Methodology

We now present WINA, a framework for sparse activation that preserves critical elements while zeroing out non-essential components in each layer’s input. As illustrated in Figure 1, WINA jointly considers both the input tensor and the associated weight matrix, rather than relying solely on input magnitudes. During inference, it activates only the most influential neurons, effectively constructing a sparse sub-network that maintains the expressive power of the original model.
Refer to caption
Figure 1: Overview of WINA. WINA performs training-free sparse activation by selecting the most influential input dimensions based on both hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise ℓ2-norms of weight matrices. This joint criterion ensures accurate sub-network activation at each layer during inference, preserving model performance while reducing computational overhead.
3.1 Problem Statement

Main Problem. Consider a deep neural network (DNN) ℳ consisting of L layers. We denote the weight matrix of the l-th layer as Wl∈ℝml×nl and the corresponding input as an arbitrary tensor X∈ℝnl×sl for l∈{1,…,L}, representing the full information content. Our goal is to identify a set of binary activation gates 𝒢={𝒈1,⋯,𝒈L}, where each 𝒈l∈{0,1}nl, such that the deviation between the model’s original output and the gated output is minimized:
	
minimize𝒈1,⋯,𝒈L∥ℳ(X)−ℳ(X∣𝒢)∥2.
		(1)

Since obtaining the complete set of possible inputs X is generally infeasible, we instead use a sampled subset X~ to approximate it. The activation gating operates in the input vector space to reduce output deviation. With this observation, we can reformulate the original problem into a per-layer version to make the problem more tractable.

Refined Problem. Given a weight matrix W∈ℝm×n and a sampled input vector 𝒙∈ℝn, the standard linear transformation is 𝒚←W⁢𝒙. Our objective then becomes identifying an activation gate or mask 𝒎∈{0,1}n such that the masked output 𝒚𝒎←W⁢(𝒎⊙𝒙) approximates the original by solving:
	
minimize𝒎∈{0,1}n‖W⁢𝒙−W⁢(𝒎⊙𝒙)‖2.
		(2)
3.2 Weight Informed Gate Function

Motivation. Many current sparse activation methods (e.g., Q-sparse (Wang et al., 2024), CATS (Lee et al., 2024), TEAL (Liu et al., 2024)) operate via a top-K gating mechanism governed by the absolute values of the hidden states:
	
𝒎i={1if ⁢|𝒙i|⁢ is among the top-K values in ⁢|𝒙|,0otherwise
		(3)

However, this approach ignores the critical role that weight matrices play. Specifically, how each element of the preceding input interacts with the weight matrix W in the forward propagation. This mismatch motivates us to propose WINA, a method that jointly considers both inputs and weight matrices to minimize the approximation error for better performance.

Formalization. In WINA, we construct binary activation gates by selecting the top-K components according to specific criteria:
	
𝒎i={1if ⁢|𝒙i⁢𝒄i|⁢ is among the top-K values in ⁢|𝒙⊙𝒄|,0otherwise,
		(4)

where 𝒄∈ℝn represents the column-wise ℓ2 norm of W and ⊙ denotes the Hadamard or element-wise product.

The choice of K can be adapted to different use cases, ranging from (1) a coarse-grained universal criterion where a shared K is applied across all layers to (2) a fine-grained layer-specific strategy that assigns K individually to better minimize approximation error.
3.3 Theoretical Analysis

WINA also offers theoretical advantages, capable of achieving a more optimal bound on the approximation error than TEAL. To demonstrate, we first present a Lemma for a single-layer network.
Lemma 3.1 (Optimal approximation error over single layer).

Let 𝐱∈ℝn be an input vector and W∈ℝm×n be a matrix satisfying column-wise orthogonality: W⊤⁢W=In where In is an identity matrix. For any target sparsity level k∈ℕ+ satisfying k<n, the expected deviation between the original network output and the gated output via WINA is less or equal to that of TEAL’s. Formally:
	
𝔼⁢[‖W⁢𝒙WINA−W⁢𝒙‖22]≤𝔼⁢[‖W⁢𝒙TEAL−W⁢x‖22],
	

where 𝐱WINA is the sparse input via WINA, retaining the k elements activated with the largest |xj⋅‖W⋅,j‖2|, and 𝐱TEAL is the sparse input via TEAL, retaining the k elements with the largest |xj|.
Proof.

See Appendix.

Using our single-layer Lemma 3.1, we can extend it to L linear layers. As stated in Theorem 3.2 below, we see that WINA still achieves smaller approximation error than TEAL in the L layer case.
Theorem 3.2 (Optimal approximation error over consecutive L layer).

Let 𝐱∈ℝd0 be an input vector and {W(ℓ)}ℓ=1N denote the weight matrices of an N-layer neural network, where each W(ℓ)∈ℝdℓ×dℓ−1. Suppose there exists a subset 𝒮⊆{1,…,N} with |𝒮|=k such that every matrix W(ℓ) with ℓ∈𝒮 is column-wise orthogonal, i.e., (W(ℓ))⊤⁢W(ℓ)=Idℓ−1. For any target sparsity level k∈ℕ+ with k<minℓ∈{1,…,N}⁡dℓ, the expected deviation satisfies:
	
𝔼⁢[‖𝒚WINA−𝒚‖22]≤𝔼⁢[‖𝒚TEAL−𝒚‖22],
		(5)

where 𝐲WINA denotes the output produced by WINA; 𝐲TEAL is the output of TEAL; and 𝐲 is the original dense network output without any sparsification.
Proof.

See Appendix.

Using these, we now consider realistic deep neural networks equipped with various activation functions. Our results remain valid for a large class of activation functions provided that they satisfy the monotonicity property (e.g., ReLU and several of its variants, sigmoidal and softmax, etc). Like before, we start with the simple single-layer case before extending to the multi-layer case. For completeness, we explicitly state the definition below.
Definition 3.3 (Monotonic increasing function (MIF)).

A function f:ℝ→ℝ is monotonically increasing if for any x1≤x2, then f⁢(x1)≤f⁢(x2).
Lemma 3.4 (Optimal approximation error over a single layer with MIF).

Let 𝐱∈ℝn be an input vector, W∈ℝm×n be a matrix that satisfies column-wise orthogonality, and f:ℝ→ℝ be an activation function that is a MIF. For any target sparsity level k∈ℕ+ satisfying k<n, the expected deviation between the original output and the gated output via WINA gating mechanism is less than or equal to that of TEAL gating mechanism. Formally:
	
𝔼⁢[‖f⁢(W⁢𝒙WINA)−f⁢(W⁢𝒙)‖22]≤𝔼⁢[‖f⁢(W⁢𝒙TEAL)−f⁢(W⁢𝒙)‖22],
	

where 𝐱WINA is the sparse input via WINA, retaining the k elements with the largest |xj⋅‖W⋅,j‖2|, and 𝐱TEAL is the sparse input via TEAL, retaining the k elements with the largest |xj|.
Proof.

See Appendix.

Finally, we extend this theorem to the case of a multi-layer network with MIF activations.
Theorem 3.5 (Optimal approximation error over consecutive L layer with MIF).

Let 𝐱∈ℝd0 be an input vector and {W(ℓ)}ℓ=1N denote the weight matrices of an N-layer neural network, where each W(ℓ)∈ℝdℓ×dℓ−1. Suppose there exists a subset 𝒮⊆{1,…,N} with |𝒮|=k such that every matrix W(ℓ) with ℓ∈𝒮 is column-wise orthogonal, i.e., (W(ℓ))⊤⁢W(ℓ)=Idℓ−1. Let f:ℝ→ℝ be an activation function satisfying the monotonic increasing property. For any target sparsity level k∈ℕ+ with k<minℓ∈{1,…,N}⁡dℓ, the expected deviation satisfies:
	
𝔼⁢[‖𝒚WINA−𝒚‖22]≤𝔼⁢[‖𝒚TEAL−𝒚‖22],
		(6)

where 𝐲WINA denotes the output produced by WINA; 𝐲TEAL is the output of TEAL; and 𝐲 is the original dense network output without any sparsification.
Proof.

See Appendix.
Remark.

Many commonly used activation functions are monotonically increasing, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, etc., or nearly monotonically increasing, such as SiLU. This fact largely ensures the generality of WINA across a wide range of deep neural network architectures.
3.4 From Theory to Practice
Motivation.

In Section 3.3, our theoretical analysis relies on the assumption of column-wise orthogonality of the relevant weight matrices, i.e., W⊤⁢W=I when, in reality, LLMs can violate the column-wise orthogonality condition. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, while preserving the theoretical error bounds, we propose a tensor transformation framework that enforces column-orthogonality in the relevant weight matrices of the model.
Transformation Protocol.

Given a weight matrix W, we can enforce column-wise orthogonality by multiplying W from the right by an orthogonal matrix Q such that the product W⁢Q has orthogonal columns. Specifically, we perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on W:
	
W=U⁢Σ⁢V⊤
	

where U and V are orthogonal matrices, and Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of W. To achieve column-orthogonality, we set Q=V and transform W as follows:
	
W^=W⁢V
	

This transformation guarantees that the resulting matrix W′ satisfies the column-orthogonality:
	
(W^)⊤⁢W^=Σ⊤⁢U⊤⁢U⁢Σ=Σ2
		(7)

To ensure that the model’s final output remains unchanged after this transformation, we compensate for its effects using computational invariance (Ashkboos et al., 2024); more specifically, we enforce column-wise orthogonality constraints on the key projection matrices Wk in the self-attention layer and the gate projection matrices Wg⁢a⁢t⁢e in the MLP layer via SVD-based transformation. We then propagate these transformations through adjacent layers and adjust the residual connections accordingly to maintain computational invariance. During inference, we employ the proposed activation criterion on these transformed column-orthogonal matrices, while using the conventional input-based activation criterion for the remaining matrices as typically done in sparse modeling.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setup

Models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of WINA and ensure coverage across different model families and sizes, we provide our results on four models: Qwen-2.5-7B (Dong et al., 2024), Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama-3-8B (Dubey et al., 2024), and Phi-4-14B (Abdin et al., 2024).

Data. We use the Alpaca dataset (Taori et al., 2023) to construct hidden states distribution and compute thresholds for each layer. The Alpaca dataset is an instruction-following dataset for fine-tuning language models, released by a research team from Stanford University with the aim of building and sharing an LLaMA model that follows instructions. The dataset contains 52,000 instructions and demonstrations generated by OpenAI’s text-davinci-003 engine.

Evaluation. We use lm-evaluation-harness pipeline (Gao et al., 2023) for our evaluations on an extensive suite of downstream tasks, including PIQA  (Bisk et al., 2020), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2019), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), Arc Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021).

Baselines. In practice, the gating strategy can be either top-k-based or threshold-based (e.g., TEAL (Liu et al., 2024) and CATS (Lee et al., 2024)). Threshold-based approaches typically determine gating thresholds by statistically analyzing hidden state distributions from a general-purpose dataset. However, directly applying these thresholds during evaluation may cause a mismatch between the actual and target sparsity levels, due to potential distributional shifts between the training and evaluation datasets. To avoid this issue and ensure a fair comparison across methods, we adopt the top-k based gating strategy in our experiments.

To eliminate the potential effect introduced by the transformation process, we introduce an additional baseline, TEAL-Transform. In this variant, the TEAL approach is applied to the transformed model, retaining the k elements with the largest absolute values |x|. This controlled baseline enables a fair comparison of different sparse activation strategies.

To further improve performance, we assign layer-specific sparsity ratios instead of a uniform sparsity across the model. Given a global sparsity target, we leverage the greedy algorithm proposed in TEAL to iteratively configure per-layer sparsity levels such that the aggregate sparsity meets the global budget. This adaptive allocation enables prioritization of computational resources for more critical parameter groups, improving overall performance.
4.2 Controlled Sparsity Experiments.

Here, we provide an empirical comparison of WINA against TEAL-based baselines (e.g., TEAL and TEAL-transform) across different sparsity levels (25% to 65%) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm under various experimental settings.

Qwen-2.5-7B.

We evaluate WINA on Qwen2.5-7B (Yang et al., 2024) across various sparsity levels (i.e, 25% – 65%) under the controlled sparsity setting. As shown in Table 1, WINA consistently matches or outperforms both TEAL and TEAL -transform across all sparsity levels. Notably, as sparsity increases, the performance gap between WINA and the baselines becomes more pronounced. For instance, at 65% sparsity, WINA outperforms TEAL by 2.94% and TEAL-transform by 1.41% on average. This trend indicates that WINA is more robust under high sparsity, likely due to its ability to retain the most influential activations by jointly considering hidden state magnitudes and weight norms. Particularly on harder tasks such as GSM8K and HellaSwag, WINA maintains relatively strong performance even when aggressive sparsification is applied.

Llama-2-7B.

On Llama-2-7B, WINA again shows strong performance under various sparsity constraints. As shown in Table 2, WINA achieves the highest average accuracy at 25% sparsity, outperforming both TEAL-based baselines and the full model. While performance naturally degrades at the extreme 65% sparsity level, WINA still offers the best accuracy, suggesting its robustness under aggressive pruning.

Llama-3-8B.

The results on Llama-3-8B further emphasize WINA’s resilience to pruning, as summarized in Table 3. While TEAL slightly outperforms at the 25% level, WINA leads in all remaining sparsity configurations, culminating in +1.06% and +2.41% over TEAL at 50% sparsity and 65% sparsity, respectively. Notably, WINA sustains particularly strong performance on reasoning-intensive tasks like GSM8K and ARC Challenge, where other methods show significant drops under compression. These patterns suggest that WINA is not only compression-friendly but also capable of preserving complex decision-making abilities under tight computational budgets.

Phi-4-14B.

WINA also delivers robust performance on Phi-4-14B across all tested sparsity levels, as detailed in Table 4. It consistently either matches or exceeds the accuracy of both TEAL and TEAL-transform, and achieves the top average score at every sparsity setting. At the highest sparsity of 65%, for instance, WINA improves upon TEAL and TEAL-transform by +2.01% and +0.86%, respectively. Its ability to retain high performance on complex benchmarks such as GSM8K and MMLU, even under severe pruning, highlights its stability. These outcomes demonstrate that WINA can effectively preserve key reasoning mechanisms in large-scale models, making it well-suited for sparsity-constrained deployments.

Acceleration.

In addition to performance gains, WINA yields substantial computational acceleration across all evaluated LLMs. As shown in Table 5, WINA reduces the overall (G)FLOPs by up to 60.0% on Qwen-2.5-7B, 63.7% on Llama-2-7B, 60.4% on Llama-3-8B, and 62.7% on Phi-4-14B at the 65% sparsity level. These consistent reductions in floating point operations could translate to faster inference speeds and lower computational costs, validating WINA’s effectiveness as a practical solution for deployment under tight resource constraints.
5 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce WINA, a training-free sparse activation framework that selects active neurons based on both hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise ℓ2-norms of subsequent weight matrices. By combining these two signals, WINA addresses key limitations of prior methods such as TEAL, which rely solely on hidden state magnitudes and often suffer from suboptimal sparsity-performance trade-offs and distribution mismatch across layers.

Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that WINA achieves a tighter bound on approximation error compared to existing approaches, under mild assumptions. To bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical deployment in pre-trained LLMs, we further adopted a tensor transformation protocol that enforces column-orthogonality in weight matrices without altering model output. Our extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures and benchmarks also validate WINA’s superior performance under controlled sparsity settings, establishing it as a new state-of-the-art in the domain of training-free sparse activation.

Let ℐ=0⁢(𝒙):={i|𝒙i=0} be the set of indices of zero elements at 𝒙. The output deviation between the original network output and the gated output via a general-format sparsification is:
	‖W⁢(𝒙ℐ=0−𝒙)‖2 	=‖∑i∈ℐ=0𝒙i⁢W:,i‖22 	
		=(∑i∈ℐ=0xi⁢W:,i)⊤⁢(∑i∈ℐ=0𝒙i⁢W:,i) 	
		=∑j∈ℐ=0∑i∈ℐ=0𝒙j⁢𝒙i⁢W:,j⊤⁢W:,i 	
		=∑i∈ℐ=0𝒙i2⁢‖W:,i‖22+∑i≠j∈ℐ=0𝒙j⁢𝒙i⁢W:,j⊤⁢W:,i 	

The expected output deviation for WINA is:
	eWINA 	=‖W⁢𝒙ℐWINA=0−W⁢𝒙‖2 	
		=∑i∈ℐWINA=0𝒙i2⁢‖W:,i‖22+∑i≠j∈ℐWINA=0𝒙j⁢𝒙i⁢W:,j⊤⁢W:,i. 	

Since W is assumed to be column orthogonal, the cross-term expectations vanish, and the expected output error is determined solely by the main term:
	
eWINA=∑i∈ℐWINA=0𝒙i2⁢‖W:,i‖22.
	

Because WINA sparsification sets the k smallest |𝒙i⁢𝒄i| terms to zero, we have the mask of WINA reaches out the lower bound of approximation error for a single layer network, i.e.,
	
𝒈WINA⁢(𝒙)=argmin𝒈∈{0,1}n‖W⁢(𝒙⊙𝒈−𝒙)‖2.
		(8)

Thus, the above indicates that WINA sparsification achieves the tight lower bound of the approximation error, including those of TEAL and CATS.
Appendix B Proof of Theorem 3.2
Proof.

We prove this by mathematical induction.
Step 1: Base case N=2.

The output error for sparse activation parameterized via mask 𝒈 is:
		‖𝒚𝒈(2)−𝒚(2)‖ 	
	= 	‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2))−W(2)⁢𝒚(1)‖ 	
	= 	‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2))−W(2)⁢𝒚𝒈(1)+W(2)⁢𝒚𝒈(1)−W(2)⁢𝒚(1)‖ 	
	= 	‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2)−𝒚𝒈(1))+W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)−𝒚(1))‖ 	
	= 	‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2)−𝒚𝒈(1))+W(2)⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙⊙𝒈(1)−W(1)⁢𝒙)‖ 	

Let:
	
Δ(1)=diag⁢(𝒈(1)−1),Δ(2)=diag⁢(𝒈(2)−1),M(1)=diag⁢(𝒈(1)).
	

Then, let 𝒗 and 𝒖 be
	𝒗 	=W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙(𝒈(2)−1)) 	
		=W(2)⁢(W(1)⁢(𝒙⊙𝒈(1))⊙(𝒈(2)−1)) 	
		=W(2)⁢Δ(2)⁢W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙 	
	𝒖 	=W(2)⁢W(1)⁢(𝒙⊙(𝒈(1)−1)) 	
		=W(2)⁢W(1)⁢Δ(1)⁢𝒙. 	

Since 𝔼⁢‖𝒖+𝒗‖2=𝔼⁢‖𝒖‖2+𝔼⁢‖𝒗‖2+2⁢𝔼⁢(𝒖⊤⁢𝒗), the expected value of the cross-term is:
	𝔼⁢[𝒖⊤⁢𝒗] 	=𝔼⁢[𝒙⊤⁢Δ(1)⁢(W(1))⊤⁢(W(2))⊤⁢(W(2))⁢Δ(2)⁢W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙] 	
		=𝔼⁢[tr⁢(W(2)⁢Δ(2)⁢W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙⁢𝒙⊤⁢Δ(1)⁢(W(1))⊤⁢(W(2))⊤)] 	
		=tr⁢(W(2)⁢𝔼⁢[Δ(2)]⁢W(1)⁢𝔼⁢[M(1)⁢Δ(1)]⁢𝔼⁢[𝒙⁢𝒙⊤]⁢(W(1))⊤⁢(W(2))⊤) 	

Since 𝔼⁢[M1⁢Δ1]=𝔼⁢[𝒈(1)⊙(𝒈(1)−1)]=0, the cross-term expectation 𝔼⁢[𝒖⊤⁢𝒗] is zero. Thus, the expected output deviation via sparse activation 𝒈,
	
e(2)=𝔼⁢[‖𝒖+𝒗‖2]=𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2)−𝒚𝒈(1))‖2]+𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙⊙𝒈(1)−W(1)⁢𝒙)‖2]
		(9)

Upon Lemma 3.1, we have that
	
𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙⊙𝒈WINA(1)−W(1)⁢𝒙)‖2]≤𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙⊙𝒈TEAL(1)−W(1)⁢𝒙)‖2]
	

Next, we compare 𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2)−𝒚𝒈(1))‖2] given 𝒈WINA(2) and 𝒈TEAL(2).
		𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2)−𝒚𝒈(1))‖2] 	
	= 	𝔼⁢[∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(2))∑i∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(2))𝒚j(1)⁢𝒚i(1)⁢(W:,j(2))⊤⁢W:,i(2)] 	
	= 	𝔼⁢[∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(2))(𝒚j(1))2⁢‖W:,j(2)‖2+∑i,j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(2))i≠j𝒚j(1)⁢𝒚i(1)⁢(W:,j(2))T⁢W:,i(2)] 	
	= 	∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(2))(𝒄j(2))2⁢𝔼⁢(𝒚j(1))2+∑i,j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(2))i≠j(W:,j(2))⊤⁢W:,i(2)⁢𝔼⁢[𝒚j(1)⁢𝒚i(1)] 	
	= 	∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(2))(𝒄j(2))2⁢𝔼⁢(𝒚j(1))2, 	

where the last line is due to W(2) is column-orthogonal, the cross-term’s expectation is zero.

Because WINA sparsification sets the k smallest (𝒚j(1)⁢cj(2))2 terms to zero, we have:
	
𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈WINA(1)⊙𝒈(2)−𝒚𝒈WINA(1))‖2]≤𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(𝒚𝒈TEAL(1)⊙𝒈(2)−𝒚𝒈TEAL(1))‖2]
	

Therefore, we have that
	
eWINA(2)≤eTEAL(2).
	
Step 2: Inductive proof for N>2.

Assume for some N≥2 that
	
eWINA(N)≤eTEAL(N).
	

Define the exact output of (N+1) layer network:
	
𝒚=W(N+1)⁢𝒚(N),𝒚(N)=W(N)⁢⋯⁢W(1)⁢𝒙
	

The output via mask 𝒈(N+1) is that
		𝒚𝒈(N+1)−𝒚 	
	= 	W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)⊙𝒈(N+1))−W(N+1)⁢𝒚(N) 	
	= 	W(N+1)⁢((𝒚𝒈(N)⊙𝒈(N+1))−𝒚𝒈(N))+W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)−𝒚(N)) 	

The expected output deviation is:
	
e𝒈N+1=𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)⊙𝒈(N+1)−𝒚𝒈(N))‖2+𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)−𝒚(N))‖2,
		(10)

the cross-term zeros out because of the assumption.

Upon induction assumption, for the second term, we have that
	
𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈WINA(N)−𝒚(N))‖2≤𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈TEAL(N)−𝒚(N))‖2.
		(11)

For the first term, we have that
		𝔼⁢[‖W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)⊙𝒈(N+1)−𝒚𝒈(N))‖2] 	
	= 	𝔼⁢[∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N+1))∑i∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N+1))𝒚j(N)⁢𝒚i(N)⁢(W:,j(N+1))⊤⁢W:,i(N+1)] 	
	= 	∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N+1))(𝒄j(N+1))2⁢𝔼⁢(𝒚j(N))2+∑i,j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N+1))i≠j(W:,j(N+1))⊤⁢W:,i(N+1)⁢𝔼⁢[𝒚j(N)⁢𝒚i(N)] 	
	= 	∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N+1))(𝒄j(N+1))2⁢𝔼⁢(𝒚j(N))2, 	

where the last line is due to W(N+1) is column-orthogonal, the cross-term’s expectation is zero.

Since WINA retains the k largest |𝒚j(N)⁢𝒄jN+1|, thus:
	
𝔼⁢[‖W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)⊙𝒈WINA(N+1)−𝒚𝒈(N))‖2]≤𝔼⁢[‖W(N+1)⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)⊙𝒈TEAL(N+1)−𝒚𝒈(N))‖2].
		(12)

Consequently, we reach the conclusion that
	eWINA(N+1)≤eTEAL(N+1). 		(13)
Appendix C Proof of Lemma 3.4
Proof.

Let Δ be the error term of the output via sparse activation parameterized with 𝒈,
	
Δ𝒈=W⁢(𝒙⊙(1−𝒈))=∑i=1dWi,:⁢𝒙i⊙(1−𝒈i).
	

Using a Taylor expansion and ignoring higher-order terms (assuming Δi is small), the output deviation given an activation function f is:
	
f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙+Δ𝒈,i)−f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙)≈∇⊤f⁢(W:,i⁢𝒙)⁢Δi.
	

Thus, the expected squared output deviation between the original output and the gated output approximates to:
	e𝒈 	=𝔼⁢‖f⁢(W⁢𝒙+Δ𝒈)−f⁢(W⁢𝒙)‖2 	
		=𝔼⁢‖∑i=1df⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙+Δ𝒈,i)−f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙)‖2 	
		≈𝔼⁢[‖∑i=1d∇f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙)⁢Δ𝒈,i‖2] 	
		=∑i=1d𝔼⁢[∇2f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙)⁢Δ𝒈,i2] 	
		=∑i=1d𝔼⁢[∇2f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙)⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙i⊙(1−𝒈i))2] 	
		=∑i=1d𝔼⁢[∇2f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙)]⁢∑i=1d𝔼⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙i⊙(1−𝒈i))2 	
		=∑i=1d𝔼⁢[∇2f⁢(Wi,:⁢𝒙)]⁢∑i∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈)d𝔼⁢[𝒄i2⁢𝒙i2] 	

Because WINA sparsification select the k smallest 𝒙j2⁢𝒄j2 terms to zero, we have that
	eWINA≤eTEAL. 		(14)
Appendix D Proof of Theorem 3.5
Proof.

We prove this by mathematical induction.
Step 1: Base case N=2.

The output error for sparse activation via 𝒈(2) is:
		‖𝒚𝒈(2)−𝒚(2)‖ 	
	= 	∥W(2)(f(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2))−W(2)f(𝒚(1))∥ 	
	= 	‖W(2)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))⊙𝒈(2))−W(2)⁢f⁢(y𝒈(1))+W(2)⁢f⁢(y𝒈(1))−W(2)⁢f⁢(𝒚(1))‖ 	
	= 	‖W(2)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1)⊙𝒈(2))−f⁢(y𝒈(1)))+W(2)⁢(f⁢(y𝒈(1))−f⁢(𝒚(1)))‖. 	

Let:
	
M(1)=diag⁢(𝒈(1)),M(2)=diag⁢(𝒈(2)−1).
	

Then, let 𝒗 and 𝒖 be
	𝒗 	=W(2)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))⊙(𝒈(2)−1)) 	
		=W(2)⁢M(2)⁢f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙) 	
	𝒖 	=W(2)⁢[f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙)−f⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙)]. 	

Let D=W(2)⊤⁢W(2), then the expected value of the cross-term becomes:
	𝔼⁢[𝒖⊤⁢𝒗] 	=𝔼⁢[f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢x)−f⁢(W(1)⁢x)]⊤⁢W(2)⊤⁢W(2)⁢M(2)⁢f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢x) 	
		=𝔼⁢[f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢x)−f⁢(W(1)⁢x)]T⁢D⁢M(2)⁢f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢x) 	
		=𝔼⁢∑iDi⁢i⋅(M(2))i⁢i⋅(f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙)i−f⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙)i)⋅f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢x)i 	

When 𝒈i(2)=1, (M(2))i⁢i=0, and the corresponding terms disappear. When 𝒈i(2)=0, (M(2))i⁢i=1. Therefore:
	
E⁢[𝒖⊤⁢𝒗]=E⁢[∑i:𝒈i(2)=0Di⁢i⋅(f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙)i−f⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙)i)⋅f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙)i]
	

Since 𝒙 follows a symmetric distribution with mean 0, and W(1) has orthogonal columns, the distributions of W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙 and W(1)⁢x are symmetric. For any activation function f, the cross-term cancels out under the symmetric distribution. Thus, the expected output deviation becomes
	e𝒈(2) 	=𝔼⁢[‖𝒖+𝒗‖2]=𝔼⁢[‖𝒖‖2]+𝔼⁢[‖𝒗‖2] 	
		=𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢M(2)⁢f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙)‖2]+𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢[f⁢(W(1)⁢M(1)⁢𝒙)−f⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙)]‖22] 	

Here, the latter one yields the below due to Lemma 3.4.
	
𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢[f⁢(W(1)⁢MWINA(1)⁢𝒙)−f⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙)]‖2]≤𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢[f⁢(W(1)⁢MTEAL(1)⁢𝒙)−f⁢(W(1)⁢𝒙)]‖2].
	

Next, we compare the former term. We have that:
		𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))⊙𝒈(2))−W(2)⁢f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))‖2] 	
	= 	𝔼⁢∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(1))∑i∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(1))f⁢(𝒚j(1))⁢f⁢(𝒚i(1))⁢(W:,j(2))T⁢W:,i(2) 	
	= 	𝔼⁢∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(1))f⁢(𝒚j(1))2⁢‖W:,j(2)‖2+∑i,j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(1))i≠jf⁢(𝒚j(1))⁢f⁢(𝒚i(1))⁢(W:,j(2))⊤⁢W:,i(2) 	
	= 	∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(1))(𝒄j(2))2⁢𝔼⁢f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(1))2+∑i,j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(1))i≠j(W:,j(2))T⁢W:,i(2)⁢𝔼⁢f⁢(𝒚j(1))⁢f⁢(𝒚i(1)) 	
	= 	∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(1))(𝒄j(2))2⁢𝔼⁢f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(1))2, 	

where the last line is due to W(2) being column-orthogonal, thereby the cross-term’s expectation is zero.

Because WINA sparsification sets the k smallest (f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(1))⁢𝒄j(2))2 terms to zero, we have that
	
𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))⊙𝒈WINA(2))−W(2)⁢f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))‖2]≤𝔼⁢[‖W(2)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))⊙𝒈TEAL(2))−W(2)⁢f⁢(𝒚𝒈(1))‖2]
	

Thus, we have that
	
eWINA(2)≤eTEAL(2).
	
Step 2: Inductive proof for N>2.

Assume for N≥2, the below holds
	
eWINA(N)≤eTEAL(N).
	

Consider the output of (N+1) layers network, i.e., 𝒚(N+1)=W(N+1)⁢f⁢(𝒚(N)).

The output deviation via sparse activation of 𝒈 is:
		𝒚𝒈(N+1)−𝒚(N+1) 	
	= 	W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))⊙𝒈(N+1))−W(N+1)⁢f⁢(𝒚(N)) 	
	= 	W(N+1)⁢((f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))⊙𝒈(N+1))−f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)))+W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))−f⁢(𝒚(N))) 	

The expected output deviation is:
	
e𝒈N+1=𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))⊙𝒈(N+1)−f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)))‖2+𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))−f⁢(𝒚(N)))‖2,
		(15)

the cross-term zeros out because of the assumption.

Upon the induction assumption, the second term yields that
	
𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈WINA(N))−f⁢(𝒚(N)))‖2≤𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈TEAL(N))−f⁢(𝒚(N)))‖2.
		(16)

For the first term, we have that
		𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))⊙𝒈(N+1)−f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)))‖2 	
	= 	𝔼⁢∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N))f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(N))2⁢‖W:,j(N+1)‖22+∑i,j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N))i≠jf⁢(𝒚𝒈,i(N))⁢f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(N))⁢(W:,j(N+1))⊤⁢W:,i(N+1) 	
	= 	𝔼⁢∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N))f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(N))2⁢‖W:,j(N+1)‖22 	
	= 	𝔼⁢∑j∈ℐ=0⁢(𝒈(N))f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(N))2⁢𝒄j2. 	

Since WINA retains the k largest 𝔼⁢[f⁢(𝒚𝒈,j(N))2⁢𝒄j2], therefore:
	
𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))⊙𝒈WINA(N+1)−f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)))‖2≤𝔼⁢‖W(N+1)⁢(f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N))⊙𝒈TEAL(N+1)−f⁢(𝒚𝒈(N)))‖2.
	

Consequently, we conclude that
	
eWINA(N+1)≤eTEAL(N+1).
	
Appendix E Resources Used & Limitations

The total run time of our experiments were run using two A100 80GB GPUs for a couple of days.

In terms of limitations, we focus the comparisons of our approach with current leading methodologies for sparse activation (i.e., TEAL [41] and CATS [36]). Naturally, we are unable to compare with all existing sparse activation methodologies and prior works, but, instead, we use these TEAL and CATS as they currently represent the current upper bound of optimal performance-efficiency trade-offs; as such, we use these approaches to compare against in order to ensure our performance tests and comparisons are robust and fair.
