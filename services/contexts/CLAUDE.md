# ACGS-2 Bounded Contexts Directory Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The `services/contexts` directory contains bounded context implementations following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for the ACGS-2 constitutional AI governance platform. This directory provides domain-specific contexts, anti-corruption layers, and integration patterns achieving P99 <5ms performance and >100 RPS throughput across context boundaries.

The bounded contexts system maintains constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` validation throughout all domain operations while providing clear domain boundaries, integration patterns, and constitutional governance with enterprise-grade domain modeling and context isolation.
