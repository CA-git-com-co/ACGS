## 🧹 Cleanup Actions Performed

### ✅ Files Removed/Cleaned:
- **Backup Files**: Removed all `.backup` and `.old` files
- **Build Artifacts**: Removed `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`
- **Temporary Data**: Removed `test-ledger/` directory
- **Duplicate Reports**: Consolidated redundant test reports
- **Outdated Scripts**: Removed deprecated utility scripts

### ✅ Files Reorganized:
- **Test Files**: Moved to appropriate test directories by type
- **Configuration**: Centralized in `config/` directory
- **Documentation**: Organized by category in `docs/`
- **Infrastructure**: Grouped by function in `infrastructure/`
- **Artifacts**: Separated by type in `artifacts/`

### ✅ Files Updated:
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite with new structure
- **Cargo.toml**: Updated workspace paths for new structure
- **Directory Documentation**: Created comprehensive structure guide

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### Workspace Configuration ✅
```toml
# Updated Cargo.toml workspace members
[workspace]
members = [
    "programs/*",
    "client/rust",
    "scripts", 
    "shared/constitutional",
    "shared/types",
    "shared/monitoring",
    "expert-service/crates/*",
    "expert-service/bin/*",
    "infrastructure/cache",
    "infrastructure/monitoring", 
    "infrastructure/cost_optimization",
    "infrastructure/connection_pool",
]
```

### Documentation Structure ✅
- **Architecture Guide**: [docs/architecture/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md](docs/architecture/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md)
- **Updated README**: [README.md](README.md)
- **Test Reports**: Organized in [docs/reports/](docs/reports/)

## ✅ Validation Results
