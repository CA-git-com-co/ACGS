   fn contains_suspicious_patterns(text: &str) -> bool {
       let suspicious_patterns = ["javascript:", "data:", "<script", "eval("];
       suspicious_patterns.iter().any(|pattern| 
           text.to_lowercase().contains(pattern))
   }
   ```

2. **Overflow Protection**
   ```rust
   pub fn checked_add(&self, other: &Self) -> Result<Self> {
       self.0.checked_add(other.0)
           .map(Self)
           .ok_or_else(|| GovernanceError::ArithmeticOverflow.into())
   }
