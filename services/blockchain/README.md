## 📋 Programs

### QuantumAGI Core Program (`programs/quantumagi-core/`)

**Purpose**: Main constitutional governance enforcement

- Constitutional principle storage and validation
- Policy proposal and voting mechanisms
- Real-time compliance checking (PGC)
- Democratic governance workflows

**Key Features**:
- Constitution account management
- Policy proposal lifecycle
- Voting power management
- Constitutional compliance validation
- Appeals mechanism integration
- Performance optimization

### Appeals Program (`programs/appeals/`)

**Purpose**: Handles appeals for governance decisions

- Appeal submission and tracking
- Multi-stage review process
- Constitutional grounds validation
- Decision reversal mechanisms

### Logging Program (`programs/logging/`)

**Purpose**: Immutable event logging for audit trails

- Governance event logging
- Performance metrics tracking
- Constitutional compliance auditing
- Integration with monitoring systems

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.26/install)"

# Install Anchor
npm install -g @coral-xyz/anchor-cli

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Build all programs
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### Testing

```bash

# Performance tests
python tools/benchmarks/performance_comparison.py

# Constitutional compliance validation
node tools/validation/constitutional_compliance_test.js
```

## 🏛️ Constitutional Framework

All operations must comply with constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`:

- **Constitutional Validation**: Every policy proposal must reference the constitutional hash
- **Compliance Checking**: Real-time validation against constitutional principles
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all governance activities
- **Performance Standards**: P99 < 5ms latency, >100 RPS throughput
