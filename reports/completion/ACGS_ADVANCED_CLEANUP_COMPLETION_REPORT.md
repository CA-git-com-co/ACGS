## üìä Detailed Implementation Results

### Phase 1: Shared Requirements Standardization ‚úÖ

**üéØ Objective**: Eliminate dependency duplication and version inconsistencies across services

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Created **4 specialized requirements files**:
  - `shared/requirements/base.txt` - Common ACGS dependencies
  - `shared/requirements/testing.txt` - Standardized testing framework
  - `shared/requirements/ml.txt` - Machine learning dependencies
  - `shared/requirements/formal.txt` - Formal verification tools
  - `shared/requirements/quantum.txt` - Quantum computing libraries

**Services Migrated**: 8 of 10 services (80% adoption rate)
- ‚úÖ Quantum Service - Full quantum + ML + base requirements
- ‚úÖ Formal Verification - Base + formal + ML requirements
- ‚úÖ Authentication Service - Base + testing (removed exact versions)
- ‚úÖ Governance Engine - Base + testing + scientific computing
- ‚úÖ Integrity Service - Base + testing only
- ‚úÖ Audit Aggregator - Base + testing + Redis optimization

        e, 
        {"operation": "operation_name", "phase": "execution_phase"}, 
        service_name="service-name"
    )
else:
    logger.error(f"Fallback error logging: {e}")
```

**Benefits Achieved**:

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Shared Requirements Architecture

The new shared requirements system follows a modular approach:

```
services/shared/requirements/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.txt          # Core ACGS dependencies (FastAPI, Pydantic, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing.txt       # Testing framework (pytest, coverage, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ml.txt           # Machine learning libraries (torch, tensorflow, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ formal.txt       # Formal verification tools (z3-solver, sympy, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quantum.txt      # Quantum computing libraries (cirq, qisim, etc.)
```

Services include relevant shared requirements:
```bash
# In service requirements.txt
-r ../../shared/requirements/base.txt
-r ../../shared/requirements/testing.txt
# Service-specific dependencies follow
```

### Cache Configuration Registry Structure

```json
{
  "constitutional_hash": "cdd01ef066bc6cf2",
  "services": {
    "service_name": {
      "cache_type": "specific_type",
      "ttl_seconds": 3600,
      "max_size": 1000,
      "warming_keys": ["key1", "key2"]
    }
  },
  "default_settings": {
    "performance_targets": {"hit_rate_target": 0.85},
    "monitoring": {"metrics_enabled": true}
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Integration

All services now use the ACGS standardized error handling pattern with constitutional compliance:

```python
from services.shared.middleware.error_handling import log_error_with_context

# Consistent error handling across services
try:
    # Service operation
    pass
except Exception as e:
    log_error_with_context(
        e, 
        {"operation": "specific_operation", "context": "additional_info"}, 
        service_name="service-name"
    )
```
