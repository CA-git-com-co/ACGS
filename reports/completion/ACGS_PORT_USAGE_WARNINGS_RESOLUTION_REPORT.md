# ACGS Port Usage Warnings Resolution Report
**Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2**  
**Report Date: 2025-07-08**  
**Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**  
**Resolution Type: Enhanced Service Recognition**

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved 5 non-critical port usage warnings in ACGS monitoring validation reports by implementing intelligent service recognition. The warnings were caused by legitimate ACGS Docker containers occupying their assigned ports, which the monitoring system was incorrectly flagging as potential conflicts.

**Key Results:**
- ✅ **Warnings Reduced**: From 5 to 0 in all monitoring reports
- ✅ **Service Recognition**: ACGS services now properly identified as expected behavior
- ✅ **Constitutional Compliance**: Hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` maintained throughout
- ✅ **Zero Disruption**: All ACGS services remained operational during resolution
- ✅ **Clean Monitoring**: Achieved clean validation reports with 100% success rate

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Warning Analysis
The ACGS monitoring validation reports consistently showed 5 non-critical warnings:

1. **Port 8001 (CONSTITUTIONAL_AI_PORT)**: "currently in use"
2. **Port 8020 (RULES_ENGINE_PORT)**: "currently in use"  
3. **Port 3001 (GRAFANA_PORT)**: "currently in use"
4. **Port 5440 (POSTGRES_PORT)**: "currently in use"
5. **Port 6390 (REDIS_PORT)**: "currently in use"

### Root Cause Investigation
Detailed analysis revealed all ports were legitimately occupied by ACGS Docker containers:

| Port | Service | Container Name | Status | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|---------|
| 8001 | Constitutional AI | `acgs_constitutional_core` | Healthy | Core AI processing |
| 8020 | Rules Engine | `acgs-rules-engine` | Healthy | Policy governance |
| 3001 | Grafana | `acgs_grafana_production` | Healthy | Monitoring dashboard |
| 5440 | PostgreSQL | `acgs_postgres_production` | Healthy | Primary database |
| 6390 | Redis | `acgs_redis_production` | Healthy | Cache and sessions |

### Service Health Verification
All services were confirmed healthy with proper constitutional compliance:

```json
Constitutional AI (8001): {
  "status": "healthy",
  "constitutional_hash": "cdd01ef066bc6cf2",
  "uptime_seconds": 1075.37
}

Rules Engine (8020): {
  "status": "healthy", 
  "constitutional_hash": "cdd01ef066bc6cf2",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}

Grafana (3001): {
  "database": "ok",
  "version": "12.0.2"
}
```

## Resolution Strategy

### Approach: Enhanced Service Recognition
Rather than suppressing warnings or changing port assignments, implemented intelligent service recognition to distinguish between:
- **Legitimate ACGS services** (expected behavior)
- **Actual port conflicts** (require warnings)

### Technical Implementation
Enhanced `scripts/validate_environment_config.py` with:

1. **New Method**: `is_acgs_service_port(port: int) -> bool`
   - Checks for ACGS service health endpoints
   - Validates constitutional hash presence
   - Verifies Docker container ownership

2. **Modified Logic**: Port checking workflow
   - Separates ACGS services from conflicts
   - Logs ACGS services as informational
   - Only warns about non-ACGS processes

3. **Service Detection**: Multi-layer verification
   - HTTP health endpoint checks for services 8001, 8020, 3001
   - Docker container verification for databases 5440, 6390
   - Constitutional hash validation for AI services

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made

#### Enhanced Port Checking Logic
```python
# Before: All ports in use generated warnings
if in_use_ports:
    self.warnings.extend(in_use_ports)

# After: Only non-ACGS processes generate warnings  
for port in ports.keys():
    if self.is_port_in_use(port):
        if self.is_acgs_service_port(port):
            acgs_service_ports.append(f"Port {port} ({ports[port]}) is used by ACGS service (expected)")
        else:
            in_use_ports.append(f"Port {port} ({ports[port]}) is currently in use by non-ACGS process")

if in_use_ports:
    self.warnings.extend(in_use_ports)  # Only actual conflicts
```

#### ACGS Service Detection Method
```python
def is_acgs_service_port(self, port: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a port is being used by a legitimate ACGS service."""
    try:
        if port == 8001:  # Constitutional AI Service
            response = subprocess.run(['curl', '-f', '-s', f'http://localhost:{port}/health'], 
                                    capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=5)
            if response.returncode == 0 and 'constitutional_hash' in response.stdout:
                return True
        elif port == 8020:  # Rules Engine Service
            response = subprocess.run(['curl', '-f', '-s', f'http://localhost:{port}/health'], 
                                    capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=5)
            if response.returncode == 0 and 'constitutional_hash' in response.stdout:
                return True
        # ... additional service checks
        return False
    except:
        return False
```
