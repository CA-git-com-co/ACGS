#### Constitutional Self-Critique Pipeline
```python
# Example usage of new self-critique system
critic = ConstitutionalSelfCritic(constitutional_hash="cdd01ef066bc6cf2")

# Perform iterative improvement
improved_content, critiques, revisions = await critic.iterative_constitutional_improvement(
    content=original_content,
    target_compliance=0.9,
    max_iterations=3
)
```

#### Reward Model Ensemble
```python
# Example usage of reward ensemble
ensemble = RewardModelEnsemble(constitutional_hash="cdd01ef066bc6cf2")

# Get robust reward prediction
prediction = await ensemble.predict_ensemble_reward(
    content=content,
    method="uncertainty_weighted"
)
```
