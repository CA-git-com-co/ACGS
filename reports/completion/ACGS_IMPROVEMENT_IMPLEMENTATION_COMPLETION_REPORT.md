```python
def main():
    """Main entry point for the Constitutional AI service."""
    try:
        # Import the FastAPI app from the refactored structure
        from app.main import app

        logger.info("🚀 Starting Constitutional AI Service")
        logger.info(f"📋 Constitutional Hash: {CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH}")

        # Run the service with proper configuration
        uvicorn.run("app.main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8001, reload=True)
```

### 2. **Health Check Middleware Integration**

**File**: `/services/shared/middleware/health_check_middleware.py`

```python
class HealthCheckManager:
    """Manages health checks for ACGS services."""

    async def get_health_status(self, level: HealthCheckLevel) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get comprehensive health status with constitutional compliance."""
        health_status = {
            "service": self.config.service_name,
            "constitutional_hash": CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH,
            "status": HealthStatus.HEALTHY,
            "constitutional_compliance": True,
            "dependencies": await self._check_dependencies(),
            "performance": await self._check_performance_metrics()
        }
```

### 3. **Prometheus Metrics Collection**

**File**: `/services/shared/middleware/prometheus_metrics_middleware.py`

```python
class ACGSPrometheusMetrics:
    """Comprehensive Prometheus metrics for ACGS services."""

    def record_constitutional_validation(self, validation_type: str, result: str, score: float):
        """Record constitutional compliance validation."""
        self.constitutional_validations_total.labels(
            service=self.service_name,
            validation_type=validation_type,
            result=result
        ).inc()

        self.constitutional_compliance_score.labels(
            service=self.service_name
        ).set(score)
```

### 4. **Dependency Management Modernization**

constitutional = [
    "z3-solver>=4.12.2.0",
    "sympy>=1.12",
    "networkx>=3.2.1",
]
