# ACGS-2 Dependency Cleanup Recommendations
Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2

## Executive Summary

The ACGS-2 project has significant dependency management issues that need addressing:
- **22 requirements.txt files** across the project with extensive duplication
- **Major version conflicts** between services (e.g., FastAPI ranges from ==0.104.1 to >=0.115.6)
- **Security packages with outdated versions** in some services
- **Unnecessary dependencies** (torch, setuptools) in multiple service files

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Version Conflicts

#### FastAPI Version Inconsistencies
- pyproject.toml: `>=0.115.6`
- Most services: `>=0.104.1` or `==0.104.1`
- **Action**: Standardize to `>=0.115.6` across all services

#### Cryptography Version Mismatches
- pyproject.toml: `>=45.0.4`
- Some services: `>=41.0.0` or `==41.0.8`
- **Action**: Update all to `>=45.0.4` for security

#### SQLAlchemy Versions
- pyproject.toml: `>=2.0.23`
- tools/requirements.txt: `==2.0.41`
- Various services: `==2.0.23` or `>=2.0.23`
- **Action**: Standardize to `>=2.0.23`

### 2. Duplicate Dependencies

The following packages appear in 10+ files with varying versions:
- fastapi (21 files)
- uvicorn (21 files)
- pydantic (21 files)
- asyncpg (15 files)
- aioredis (12 files)
- httpx (19 files)
- prometheus-client (18 files)
- cryptography (17 files)

### 3. Security Concerns

Several services are using outdated versions of security-critical packages:
- Some services still use `cryptography==41.0.8` (should be `>=45.0.4`)
- Mixed versions of `urllib3` and `certifi`
- Inconsistent `pyjwt` versions

### 4. Unnecessary Dependencies

#### torch (PyTorch)
- Appears in authentication service, formal verification, and others
- Likely not needed for these services
- **Action**: Remove unless explicitly required

#### setuptools
- Appears in many runtime requirements files
- Should only be in build/development dependencies
- **Action**: Move to dev dependencies only

#### ecdsa
- Appears in 7 files but usage unclear
- **Action**: Verify if actually needed

## Recommended Consolidation Strategy

### 1. Create Base Requirements Files

Create three base requirements files in `/services/shared/requirements/`:

#### requirements-base.txt
```txt
# Core dependencies for all ACGS services
# Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2

fastapi>=0.115.6
uvicorn[standard]>=0.34.0
pydantic>=2.10.5
pydantic-settings>=2.7.1

# Database
asyncpg>=0.29.0
sqlalchemy[asyncio]>=2.0.23
aioredis>=2.0.1

# HTTP
httpx>=0.28.1
aiohttp>=3.9.0

# Security
cryptography>=45.0.4
python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0
passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4
python-multipart>=0.0.20

# Monitoring
prometheus-client>=0.19.0
structlog>=23.2.0

# Utils
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
tenacity>=8.2.3
```

#### requirements-test.txt
```txt
# Testing dependencies
-r requirements-base.txt

pytest>=7.4.3
pytest-asyncio>=0.21.1
pytest-cov>=4.1.0
pytest-mock>=3.14.1
httpx>=0.28.1
fakeredis>=2.18.0
factory-boy>=3.3.0
```

#### requirements-dev.txt
```txt
# Development dependencies
-r requirements-test.txt

black>=23.11.0
isort>=5.12.0
ruff>=0.1.6
mypy>=1.7.0
pre-commit>=3.4.0
bandit>=1.7.5
safety>=2.3.0
```

### 2. Update Service Requirements

Each service should have a minimal requirements.txt:
```txt
# Service-specific requirements
-r ../../shared/requirements/requirements-base.txt

# Additional service-specific dependencies only
# e.g., for formal verification service:
z3-solver>=4.12.6.0
```

### 3. Remove Redundant Dependencies

From all service requirements files, remove:
- Core dependencies already in requirements-base.txt
- Build tools (setuptools, wheel)
- Unnecessary ML libraries (torch, unless specifically needed)
- Duplicate security packages

### 4. Standardize Version Specifications

Use consistent version operators:
- `>=` for stable, well-maintained packages
- `~=` for packages where minor version compatibility matters
- `==` only for packages with known compatibility issues

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Create Shared Requirements**
   - Create `/services/shared/requirements/` directory
   - Add base requirements files
   - Test with one service first

2. **Phase 2: Update Service Files**
   - Update each service's requirements.txt to use base files
   - Remove redundant dependencies
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Phase 3: Update CI/CD**
   - Update Docker builds to use new structure
   - Update documentation
   - Add dependency validation to CI

4. **Phase 4: Monitoring**
   - Add automated dependency scanning
   - Set up Dependabot or similar for updates
   - Regular security audits

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All services use same core versions
2. **Security**: Easier to update security-critical packages
3. **Maintenance**: Single source of truth for core dependencies
4. **Performance**: Reduced Docker image sizes
5. **Development**: Faster dependency installation

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create shared requirements structure
3. Migrate services incrementally
4. Update CI/CD pipelines
5. Document new dependency management process



## Implementation Status

- âœ… **Constitutional Hash Validation**: Active enforcement of `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
- ðŸ”„ **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of targets
- âœ… **Documentation Standards**: Compliant with ACGS-2 requirements
- ðŸ”„ **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ongoing link integrity maintenance

**Overall Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Systematic enhancement implementation

## Performance Targets

This component maintains the following performance requirements:

- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
