# ACGS-PGP Next Steps Documentation

**Generated:** 2025-01-25T12:00:00Z  
**Constitutional Hash:** `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`  
**System Status:** ENHANCED & READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

## Immediate Next Steps (Next 48 Hours)

### Step 1: Service Startup & Validation (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Objective:** Start all 7 ACGS-PGP services and validate operational status

**Commands to Execute:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/ubuntu/ACGS

# Start all core services
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.acgs.yml up -d

# Start monitoring stack
cd infrastructure/monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d

# Start OPA policy engine
cd ../opa
docker-compose -f docker-compose.opa.yml up -d

# Validate all services are running
for port in {8000..8006}; do
  echo "Checking service on port $port..."
  curl -f "http://localhost:$port/health" || echo "❌ Service on port $port not responding"
done

# Check monitoring services
curl -f "http://localhost:9090" && echo "✅ Prometheus running"
curl -f "http://localhost:3000" && echo "✅ Grafana running"
curl -f "http://localhost:8181/health" && echo "✅ OPA running"
```

**Expected Results:**

- All 7 services responding on ports 8000-8006
- Prometheus accessible on port 9090
- Grafana accessible on port 3000
- OPA accessible on port 8181

### Step 2: Constitutional Compliance Validation (Priority: HIGH)

**Objective:** Verify constitutional compliance across all services

**Validation Commands:**

```bash
# Run constitutional compliance validation
python scripts/validate_constitutional_compliance.py

# Check constitutional hash consistency
grep -r "cdd01ef066bc6cf2" services/ | wc -l

# Validate DGM safety patterns
python scripts/validate_dgm_safety_patterns.py
```

**Success Criteria:**

- Constitutional compliance score >95% for all services
- Constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` consistent across all configurations
- DGM safety patterns (sandbox + human review + rollback) operational

### Step 3: Security Vulnerability Remediation (Priority: HIGH)

**Objective:** Address 12 high-priority security vulnerabilities

**Remediation Commands:**

```bash
# Address Python security issues
bandit -r services/ -f json -o reports/bandit_remediation.json

# Update vulnerable dependencies
pip install --upgrade fastapi pydantic starlette

# Fix shell injection vulnerabilities
# Manual code review required for subprocess calls

# Update Node.js dependencies
pnpm audit --fix
```

**Timeline:** 24-48 hours for complete remediation

**Shutdown Procedure:**

```bash
# Immediate shutdown (Execute within 5 minutes)
kubectl scale deployment --replicas=0 --all -n acgs-production

# Or using Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down

# Verify all services stopped
kubectl get pods -n acgs-production
```

**Recovery Procedure:**
