## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues
1. **Service Directory Structure Mismatch:** The Dockerfile expects different paths than current service organization
2. **Module Import Dependencies:** Missing timeout module and other shared components
3. **Build Context Configuration:** Docker build paths don't align with reorganized service structure
4. **Test Environment Setup:** Module resolution issues prevent benchmark execution

### Secondary Issues
1. **Port Standardization:** System reserved ports causing conflicts
2. **Test Configuration:** pytest arguments incompatible with current setup
3. **Service Dependencies:** Circular dependency resolution needed for startup

## Immediate Recommendations

### Phase 1: Service Deployment Fix (Priority: CRITICAL)
```bash
# 1. Fix Dockerfile service paths
# Update infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.acgs to match current structure

# 2. Create missing requirements.txt files
# Generate service-specific dependency files

# 3. Update docker-compose service paths
# Align working directories with actual service locations

# 4. Resolve module dependencies
# Create missing shared modules or update imports
```

### Phase 2: Performance Testing Resolution (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# 1. Fix module imports
# Implement missing services.shared.resilience.timeout

# 2. Update pytest configuration
# Remove incompatible hypothesis arguments

# 3. Create isolated performance tests
# Tests that don't require full service stack
```

### Phase 3: Documentation and Security (Priority: MEDIUM)
```bash
# 1. Generate updated API documentation
# Run documentation tools with corrected service paths

# 2. Execute security audits
# Once services are running, perform comprehensive security validation

# 3. Update deployment guides
# Document corrected service deployment procedures
```

## Next Steps for Complete Validation

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Fix Dockerfile paths** to match current service structure
2. **Create minimal requirements.txt** files for each service
3. **Update docker-compose working directories** 
4. **Start core infrastructure services** (postgres, redis, opa)

### Short-term Actions (Next 2 hours)
1. **Deploy and validate core services** one by one
2. **Execute performance benchmarks** with fixed dependencies
3. **Run comprehensive security audit** on running services
4. **Generate updated API documentation** with service annotations

### Medium-term Actions (Next 24 hours)
1. **Full integration testing** with all services running
2. **Production readiness assessment** 
3. **Complete documentation generation** including SDKs
4. **Security hardening validation**
