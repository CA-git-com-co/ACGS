**Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2**


**Constitutional Hash:** `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
**Analysis Date:** July 14, 2025
**Scope:** Comprehensive root directory structure analysis and reorganization plan
**Methodology:** Foresight Loop (ANTICIPATE â†’ PLAN â†’ EXECUTE â†’ REFLECT)

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies critical organizational issues in the ACGS-2 root directory and provides a comprehensive reorganization plan to improve maintainability, compliance, and operational efficiency. The current structure contains 200+ files in the root directory, creating navigation challenges and violating best practices.

### Key Findings
- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: 47 documentation files scattered in root (should be in docs/)
- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: 23 configuration files misplaced (should be in config/)
- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: 15 standalone scripts in root (should be in scripts/)
- **ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE**: 8 temporary/generated files requiring cleanup
- **ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE**: Multiple backup files (.backup) cluttering structure
- **ðŸŸ¢ MINOR**: Some files already properly organized
