The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or

service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.\n\nWhere access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission\/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability.\n\nTemporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include when shared\/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared\/group authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training."},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-02","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-2_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-02a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-2_obj.a-1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-02a.[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"account

An example of dynamic privilege management is the immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, if their job function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations.

Mandatory access control policies constrain what actions subjects can take with information obtained from objects for which they have already been granted access. This prevents the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. Mandatory access control policies constrain actions that subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement is provided by an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept as described in [AC-25](#ac-25) . The policy is bounded by the system (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect).\n\nThe trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see [AC-6](#ac-6) ). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges necessary for satisfying organizational mission\/business needs relative to the above policy. The control is most applicable when there is a mandate that establishes a policy regarding access to controlled unclassified information or classified information and some users of the system are not authorized access to all such information resident in the system. Mandatory access control can operate in conjunction with discretionary access control as described in [AC-3(4)](#ac-3.4) . A subject constrained in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4), but mandatory access control policies take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint that prevents a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any other subject with the same impact or classification level as the subject. Examples of mandatory access control policies include the Bell-LaPadula policy to protect confidentiality of information and the Biba policy to protect the integrity of

Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing the information to other subjects or objects (i.e., subjects have the discretion to pass). Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with mandatory access control as described in [AC-3(3)](#ac-3.3) and [AC-3(15)](#ac-3.15) . A subject that is constrained in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous constraints of discretionary access control. Therefore, while [AC-3(3)](#ac-3.3) imposes constraints that prevent a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level, [AC-3(4)](#ac-3.4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same impact or classification level. The policy is bounded by the system. Once the information is passed outside of system control, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this particular use of discretionary access control."},{"id":"ac-3.4_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-03(04)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-3.4_obj-1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-03(04)[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"{{

information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see [CA-3](#ca-3) ). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners\/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.\n\nOrganizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and\/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and\/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS)."},{"id":"ac-4_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"approved authorizations are enforced for controlling the flow of

Organizations can implement more than one security or privacy policy filter to meet information flow control objectives."},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)(a)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.a-1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)(a)[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"information flow control is enforced using {{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.01 }} as a basis for flow control decisions for {{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.03 }};","links":[{"href":"#ac-4.8_smt.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.a-2","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)(a)[02]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"information flow control is enforced using {{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.02 }} as a basis for flow control decisions for {{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.04 }};","links":[{"href":"#ac-4.8_smt.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-4.8_smt.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.b","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)(b)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"{{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.05 }} data after a filter processing failure in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.06 }};\n\n{{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.05 }} data after a filter processing failure in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-04.08_odp.07 }}.","links":[{"href":"#ac-4.8_smt.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-4.8_smt","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"ac-4.8_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Access control policy\n\ninformation flow control policies\n\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nlist of security policy filters regulating flow control decisions\n\nlist of privacy policy filters regulating flow control decisions\n\nsystem audit records\n\nsystem security plan\n\nprivacy plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"ac-4.8_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"System\/network administrators\n\norganizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities\n\nsystem developers"}]},{"id":"ac-4.8_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(08)-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy\n\nsecurity and privacy policy filters"}]}]},{"id":"ac-4.9","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Human Reviews","params":[{"id":"ac-04.09_odp.01","props":[{"name":"alt-identifier","value":"ac-4.9_prm_1"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(09)_ODP[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"label":"information flows","guidelines":[{"prose":"information flows requiring the use of human reviews are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.09_odp.02","props":[{"name":"alt-identifier","value":"ac-4.9_prm_2"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(09)_ODP[02]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"label":"conditions","guidelines":[{"prose":"conditions under which the use of human reviews for information flows are to be enforced are defined;"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(09)","class":"zero-padded"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(9)"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(09)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-04.09"},{"name":"implementation-level","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"organization"},{"name":"implementation-level","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"system"}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"required"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.9_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Enforce the use of human reviews for {{ insert: param, ac-04.09_odp.01 }} under the following conditions: {{ insert: param, ac-04.09_odp.02 }}."},{"id":"ac-4.9_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Organizations define security or privacy policy filters for all situations where automated flow control decisions are possible.

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, organization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks.

Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures, such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions that represent the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently or in conjunction with security attributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of active or passive entities with respect to the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes can be either explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or system components.\n\nAttributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, cause information to flow among objects, or change the system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Attributes, when bound to data or information, permit the enforcement of security and privacy policies for access control and information flow control, including data retention limits, permitted uses of personally identifiable information, and identification of personal information within data objects. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play important parts in the trust that organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.\n\nOrganizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support missions or business functions. There are many values that can be assigned to a security attribute. By specifying the permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations ensure that attribute values are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects and objects represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates system-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels include classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential, controlled unclassified), information impact level; high value asset information, access authorizations, nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), personally identifiable information processing permissions, including individual consent to personally identifiable information processing, and contractor affiliation. A related term to labeling is marking. Marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a human-readable form and displayed on system media. Marking enables manual, procedural, or process-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Security and privacy labels may have the same value as media markings (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential). See [MP-3](#mp-3) (Media Marking)."},{"id":"ac-16_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-16_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-16_obj.a-1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16a.[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"the

Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections.

Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and\/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook\/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\n\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\n\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements specified in [AC-19](#ac-19) . Many safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other controls.

implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\n\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.\n\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope of [AC-20](#ac-20) . Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems."},{"id":"ac-20_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20_obj.a.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20a.01","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"{{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.01 }} is\/are consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and\/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to access the system from external systems (if applicable);","links":[{"href":"#ac-20_smt.a.1","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"ac-20_obj.a.2","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20a.02","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"{{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.01 }} is\/are consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and\/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems (if applicable);","links":[{"href":"#ac-20_smt.a.2","rel":"assessment-for"}]}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-20_smt.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"ac-20_obj.b","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20b.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"the use of {{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.04 }} is prohibited (if applicable).","links":[{"href":"#ac-20_smt.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-20_smt","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"ac-20_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Access control policy\n\nprocedures addressing the use of external systems\n\nexternal systems terms and conditions\n\nlist of types of applications accessible from external systems\n\nmaximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems\n\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"ac-20_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining terms and conditions for use of external systems to access organizational systems\n\nsystem\/network administrators\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"id":"ac-20_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on the use of external systems"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-20.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Limits on Authorized Use","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(01)","class":"zero-padded"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(1)"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(01)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-20.01"},{"name":"implementation-level","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"organization"}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"required"},{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or"},{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.b","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external system."}]},{"id":"ac-20.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using external systems may need to access organizational systems.

analytical process that attempts to find correlations or patterns in large data sets for the purpose of data or knowledge discovery. Data storage objects include database records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from data mining operations. When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated revelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data mining activities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations may be subject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address data mining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such requirements.\n\nData mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and frequency of database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of databases, limiting types of responses provided to database queries, applying differential privacy techniques or homomorphic encryption, and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining while such information resides in organizational data stores. In contrast, [AU-13](#au-13) focuses on monitoring for organizational information that may have been mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is available as open-source information residing on external sites, such as social networking or social media websites.\n\n[EO 13587](#0af071a6-cf8e-48ee-8c82-fe91efa20f94) requires the establishment of an insider threat program for deterring, detecting, and mitigating insider threats, including the safeguarding of sensitive information from exploitation, compromise, or other unauthorized disclosure.

A reference validation mechanism is always invoked, tamper-proof, and small enough to be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which can be assured (i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated with data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof property of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the functioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy.

The content includes an understanding of the need for security and privacy as well as actions by users to maintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content addresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable information.\n\nAwareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training after the initial training described in [AT-2a.1](#at-2_smt.a.1) is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent attack schemes, changes to organizational security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy expectations, or a subset of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a regular basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant.

The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system.\n\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage.\n\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include [AC-2(4)](#ac-2.4), [AC-3(10)](#ac-3.10), [AC-6(9)](#ac-6.9), [AC-17(1)](#ac-17.1), [CM-3f](#cm-3_smt.f), [CM-5(1)](#cm-5.1), [IA-3(3)(b)](#ia-3.3_smt.b), [MA-4(1)](#ma-4.1), [MP-4(2)](#mp-4.2), [PE-3](#pe-3), [PM-21](#pm-21), [PT-7](#pt-7), [RA-8](#ra-8), [SC-7(9)](#sc-7.9), [SC-7(15)](#sc-7.15), [SI-3(8)](#si-3.8), [SI-4(22)](#si-4.22), [SI-7(8)](#si-7.8) , and [SI-10(1)](#si-10.1) . Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented architectures."},{"id":"au-2_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-02","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-02a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"{{

Time service can be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities."},{"id":"au-8_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-08","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-8_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-08a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"internal system clocks are used to generate timestamps for audit records;","links":[{"href":"#au-8_smt.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"au-8_obj.b","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-08b.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"timestamps are recorded for audit records that meet {{ insert: param, au-08_odp }} and that use Coordinated Universal Time, have a fixed local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time, or include the local time offset as part of the timestamp.","links":[{"href":"#au-8_smt.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]}],"links":[{"href":"#au-8_smt","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"au-8_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-08-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Audit and accountability policy\n\nsystem security plan\n\nprivacy plan\n\nprocedures addressing timestamp generation\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nsystem audit records\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"au-8_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-08-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities\n\nsystem\/network administrators\n\nsystem developers"}]},{"id":"au-8_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-08-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Mechanisms implementing timestamp generation"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"au-8.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-08(01)","class":"zero-padded"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(1)"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-08(01)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"au-08.01"},{"name":"status","value":"withdrawn"}],"links":[{"href":"#sc-45.1","rel":"moved-to"}]},{"id":"au-8.2","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Secondary Authoritative Time Source","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-08(02)","class":"zero-padded"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(2)"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-08(02)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"au-08.02"},{"name":"status","value":"withdrawn"}],"links":[{"href":"#sc-45.2","rel":"moved-to"}]}]},{"id":"au-9","class":"SP800-53","title":"Protection of Audit Information","params":[{"id":"au-09_odp","props":[{"name":"alt-identifier","value":"au-9_prm_1"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-09_ODP","class":"sp800-53a"}],"label":"personnel or roles","guidelines":[{"prose":"personnel or roles to be alerted upon detection of unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of audit information is\/are defined;"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-09","class":"zero-padded"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-9"},{"name":"label","value":"AU-09","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"au-09"},{"name":"implementation-level","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"system"}],"links":[{"href":"#678e3d6c-150b-4393-aec5-6e3481eb1e00","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#eea3c092-42ed-4382-a6f4-1adadef01b9d","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#a295ca19-8c75-4b4c-8800-98024732e181","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-11","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-14","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-15","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pe-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pe-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-8","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-9_smt","name":"statement","parts":[{"id":"au-9_smt.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion;

Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

assessments of system-specific, hybrid, common, and program management controls, as appropriate. The required skills include general knowledge of risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive knowledge of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components implemented.\n\nOrganizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, system design and development, systems security engineering, privacy engineering, and the system development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information security and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system design and development process, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design to implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are assessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing previously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.\n\nOrganizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates the roles and responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a system, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.\n\nOrganizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail, as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials, senior agency officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and authorizing official designated representatives.\n\nTo satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations, continuous monitoring, systems engineering processes, or system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations assess controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies.

conduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.\n\nIndependent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and\/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have sufficient independence, such as when system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the assessments. During the system design and development phase, having independent assessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.\n\nWhen organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support authorization decisions are more likely to be useable for such decisions when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments."},{"id":"ca-2.1_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(01)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"independent assessors or assessment teams are employed to conduct control assessments.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2.1_smt","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"ca-2.1_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(01)-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy\n\nprocedures addressing control assessments\n\nprevious control assessment plan\n\nprevious control assessment report\n\nplan of action and milestones\n\nexisting authorization statement\n\nsystem security plan\n\nprivacy plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"ca-2.1_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(01)-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with security assessment responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities"}]}]},{"id":"ca-2.2","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Specialized Assessments","params":[{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.01","props":[{"name":"alt-identifier","value":"ca-2.2_prm_1"},{"name":"alt-label","value":"frequency","class":"sp800-53"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(02)_ODP[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"label":"specialized assessment frequency","guidelines":[{"prose":"frequency at which to include specialized assessments as part of the control assessment is defined;"}]},{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.02","props":[{"name":"alt-identifier","value":"ca-2.2_prm_2"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(02)_ODP[02]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"select":{"choice":["announced","unannounced"]}},{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.03","props":[{"name":"alt-identifier","value":"ca-2.2_prm_3"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(02)_ODP[03]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"select":{"how-many":"one-or-more","choice":["in-depth monitoring","security instrumentation","automated security test cases","vulnerability scanning","malicious user testing","insider threat assessment","performance and load testing","data leakage or data loss assessment","{{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.04 }} "]}},{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.04","props":[{"name":"alt-identifier","value":"ca-2.2_prm_4"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(02)_ODP[04]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"label":"other forms of assessment","guidelines":[{"prose":"other forms of assessment are defined (if selected);"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(02)","class":"zero-padded"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(2)"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(02)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ca-02.02"},{"name":"implementation-level","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"organization"},{"name":"contributes-to-assurance","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"true"}],"links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"required"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-2.2_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Include as part of control assessments, {{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.01 }}, {{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.02 }}, {{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.03 }}."},{"id":"ca-2.2_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Organizations can conduct specialized assessments, including verification and validation, system monitoring, insider threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing.

The authorization process is a federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities.\n\nAuthorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence produced from implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common control providers, and system owners with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their systems, controls, and operating environments.

organizational risk management decisions. The terms \"continuous\" and \"ongoing\" imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security and privacy information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the ability to make effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions.\n\nAutomation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware inventories, authorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of systems.

At worst, it could mean that some of the controls implemented in one location or by one component are actually impeding the functionality of other controls (e.g., encrypting internal network traffic can impede monitoring).

conducted on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and\/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).\n\nOrganizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in the exposure of information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting the testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms can be used to communicate expectations for how to protect this information.

Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission\/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to configuration management policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security and privacy posture or functionality of the system.

Parameters that impact the security posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols, ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are parameters impacting the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to satisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data processing preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.\n\nCommon secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology products and platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private sectors.\n\nImplementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization level, mission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline [USGCB](#98498928-3ca3-44b3-8b1e-f48685373087) and security technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the implementation of [CM-6](#cm-6) and other controls such as [AC-19](#ac-19) and [CM-7](#cm-7) .

Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services.

Organizations may choose to implement centralized system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information, component type, and physical location.\n\nPreventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association is not known, especially in large or complex connected systems. Effective prevention of duplicate accounting of system components necessitates use of a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the system on which it is installed and managed.

Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.\n\nConfiguration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition stage of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through change management processes; update configuration settings and baselines; maintain component inventories; control development, test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and update key documents.\n\nOrganizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a configuration management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include the designation of key stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, such as the hardware, software, firmware, and documentation to be configuration-managed.

organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\n\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in [IR-4(5)](#ir-4.5) . Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the [IR](#ir) (Incident Response)

satisfy the identification and authentication requirements by complying with the requirements in [HSPD 12](#f16e438e-7114-4144-bfe2-2dfcad8cb2d0) . Organizational users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in [AC-14](#ac-14) and that occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\n\nOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks.\n\nThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.
