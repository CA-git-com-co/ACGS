Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission\/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission\/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared\/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-10","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ma-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

While user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission\/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for communications.

The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission\/business needs. The control is most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive\/classified information and some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive\/classified information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the subject.","links":[{"href":"#ac-25","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-11","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines mandatory access control policies to be enforced over all subjects and objects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[2]"}],"prose":"the organization defines subjects over which organization-defined mandatory access control policies are to be enforced;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[3]"}],"prose":"the organization defines objects over which organization-defined mandatory access control policies are to be enforced;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.4","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[4]"}],"prose":"the organization defines subjects that may explicitly be granted privileges such that they are not limited by the constraints specified elsewhere within this control;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.5","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[5]"}],"prose":"the organization defines privileges that may be granted to organization-defined subjects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.6","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6]"}],"prose":"the information system enforces organization-defined mandatory access control policies over all subjects and objects where the policy specifies that:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.a_obj.6","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](a)"}],"prose":"the policy is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the information system;","links":[{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.a","rel":"corresp"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3.b_obj.6","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)"}],"prose":"a subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the following:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.b.1_obj.6","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(1)"}],"prose":"passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;","links":[{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.b.1","rel":"corresp"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.2_obj.6","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(2)"}],"prose":"granting its privileges to other subjects;","links":[{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.b.2","rel":"corresp"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)"}],"prose":"changing one or more security attributes on:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.a","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[a]"}],"prose":"subjects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.b","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[b]"}],"prose":"objects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.c","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[c]"}],"prose":"the information system;

Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the information on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to make a determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer.

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners\/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and\/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering\/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-21","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-18","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ac-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-4_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines information flow control policies to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems; and"},{"id":"ac-4_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[2]"}],"prose":"the information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on organization-defined information flow control policies."}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\n\ninformation flow control policies\n\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\n\ninformation system design documentation\n\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\n\ninformation system baseline configuration\n\nlist of information flow authorizations\n\ninformation system audit records\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System\/network administrators\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem developers"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-4.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Object Security Attributes","params":[{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined security attributes"},{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_2","label":"organization-defined information, source, and destination objects"},{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_3","label":"organization-defined information flow control policies"}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-04.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system uses {{ insert: param, ac-4.1_prm_1 }} associated with {{ insert: param, ac-4.1_prm_2 }} to enforce {{ insert: param, ac-4.1_prm_3 }} as a basis for flow control decisions."},{"id":"ac-4.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes associated with information (data content and data structure) and source\/destination objects, and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies.

Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data\/information, enables the enforcement of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support missions\/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include, for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based attribute association (marking).

Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization.

Organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-18","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-9","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ia-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-43","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ac-19_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-19.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-19(a)"}],"prose":"establishes for organization-controlled mobile devices:","parts":[{"id":"ac-19.a_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-19(a)[1]"}],"prose":"usage restrictions;"},{"id":"ac-19.a_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-19(a)[2]"}],"prose":"configuration\/connection requirement;"},{"id":"ac-19.a_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-19(a)[3]"}],"prose":"implementation guidance;

External information systems include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems\/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems. For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing\/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-9","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ac-20_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and\/or maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to:","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(a)"}],"prose":"access the information system from the external information systems; and"},{"id":"ac-20.b_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(b)"}],"prose":"process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information systems."}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\n\nprocedures addressing the use of external information systems\n\nexternal information systems terms and conditions\n\nlist of types of applications accessible from external information systems\n\nmaximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems\n\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining terms and conditions for use of external information systems to access organizational systems\n\nsystem\/network administrators\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on use of external information systems"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-20.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Limits On Authorized Use","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-20.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only when the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s information security policy and security plan; or"},{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.b","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external information system."}]},{"id":"ac-20.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational information systems.

Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.","links":[{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"au-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the auditable events that the information system must be capable of auditing;"},{"id":"au-2.a_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the information system is capable of auditing organization-defined auditable events;"}]},{"id":"au-2.b_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(b)"}],"prose":"coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;"},{"id":"au-2.c_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(c)"}],"prose":"provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.d_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a that are to be audited within the information system;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a are to be audited within the information system; and"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[3]"}],"prose":"determines the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event."}]}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Audit and accountability policy\n\nprocedures addressing auditable events\n\nsecurity plan\n\ninformation system design documentation\n\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\n\ninformation system audit records\n\ninformation system auditable events\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem\/network administrators"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information system auditing"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"au-2.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Compilation of Audit Records from Multiple Sources","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"au-02.01"},{"name":"status","value":"Withdrawn"}],"links":[{"href":"#au-12","rel":"incorporated-into"}]},{"id":"au-2.2","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Selection of Audit Events by Component","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(2)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"au-02.02"},{"name":"status","value":"Withdrawn"}],"links":[{"href":"#au-12","rel":"incorporated-into"}]},{"id":"au-2.3","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Reviews and Updates","params":[{"id":"au-2.3_prm_1","label":"organization-defined frequency"}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(3)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"au-02.03"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.3_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization reviews and updates the audited events {{ insert: param, au-2.3_prm_1 }}."},{"id":"au-2.3_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Over time, the events that organizations believe should be audited may change.

Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.","links":[{"href":"#au-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"au-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"au-8.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(a)"}],"prose":"the information system uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records;"},{"id":"au-8.b_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-8.b_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(b)[1]"}],"prose":"the information system records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT);"},{"id":"au-8.b_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(b)[2]"}],"prose":"the organization defines the granularity of time measurement to be met when recording time stamps for audit records;

Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example, near real-time, within minutes, or within hours.","links":[{"href":"#au-7","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"au-12.3_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"au-12.3_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-12(3)[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines information system components on which auditing is to be performed;"},{"id":"au-12.3_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-12(3)[2]"}],"prose":"the organization defines individuals or roles authorized to change the auditing to be performed on organization-defined information system components;"},{"id":"au-12.3_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-12(3)[3]"}],"prose":"the organization defines time thresholds within which organization-defined individuals or roles can change the auditing to be performed on organization-defined information system components;"},{"id":"au-12.3_obj.4","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-12(3)[4]"}],"prose":"the organization defines selectable event criteria that support the capability for organization-defined individuals or roles to change the auditing to be performed on organization-defined information system components;

(ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.","links":[{"href":"#ca-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-11","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-12","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ca-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ca-2.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(a)"}],"prose":"develops a security assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment including:","parts":[{"id":"ca-2.a.1_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(a)(1)"}],"prose":"security controls and control enhancements under assessment;"},{"id":"ca-2.a.2_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(a)(2)"}],"prose":"assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness;"},{"id":"ca-2.a.3_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(a)(3)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-2.a.3_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(a)(3)[1]"}],"prose":"assessment environment;"},{"id":"ca-2.a.3_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(a)(3)[2]"}],"prose":"assessment team;"},{"id":"ca-2.a.3_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(a)(3)[3]"}],"prose":"assessment roles and responsibilities;"}]}]},{"id":"ca-2.b_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-2.b_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to assess the security controls in the information system and its environment of operation;"},{"id":"ca-2.b_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(b)[2]"}],"prose":"assesses the security controls in the information system with the organization-defined frequency to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting established security requirements;"}]},{"id":"ca-2.c_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(c)"}],"prose":"produces a security assessment report that documents the results of the assessment;"},{"id":"ca-2.d_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(d)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-2.d_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(d)[1]"}],"prose":"defines individuals or roles to whom the results of the security control assessment are to be provided; and"},{"id":"ca-2.d_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(d)[2]"}],"prose":"provides the results of the security control assessment to organization-defined individuals or roles."}]}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Security assessment and authorization policy\n\nprocedures addressing security assessment planning\n\nprocedures addressing security assessments\n\nsecurity assessment plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with security assessment responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms supporting security assessment, security assessment plan development, and\/or security assessment reporting"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ca-2.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Independent Assessors","params":[{"id":"ca-2.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined level of independence"}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ca-02.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-2.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with {{ insert: param, ca-2.1_prm_1 }} to conduct security control assessments."},{"id":"ca-2.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems.

Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining whether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations, for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.

Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission\/business operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date status of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation.

Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through reports\/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware\/software\/firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of information systems.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-11","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-12","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ca-7_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses\/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities.

All parties agree to the rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios.

Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"cm-5_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-5_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-5[1]"}],"prose":"defines physical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system;"},{"id":"cm-5_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-5[2]"}],"prose":"documents physical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system;"},{"id":"cm-5_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-5[3]"}],"prose":"approves physical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system;"},{"id":"cm-5_obj.4","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-5[4]"}],"prose":"enforces physical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system;"},{"id":"cm-5_obj.5","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-5[5]"}],"prose":"defines logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system;"},{"id":"cm-5_obj.6","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-5[6]"}],"prose":"documents logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system;"},{"id":"cm-5_obj.7","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-5[7]"}],"prose":"approves logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system;

Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input\/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms\/products and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports\/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.","links":[{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"cm-7_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(a)"}],"prose":"configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines prohibited or restricted:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.a","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][a]"}],"prose":"functions;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.b","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][b]"}],"prose":"ports;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.c","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][c]"}],"prose":"protocols; and\/or"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.d","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][d]"}],"prose":"services;"}]},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2]"}],"prose":"prohibits or restricts the use of organization-defined:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.a","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][a]"}],"prose":"functions;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.b","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][b]"}],"prose":"ports;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.c","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][c]"}],"prose":"protocols; and\/or"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.d","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][d]"}],"prose":"services."}]}]}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Configuration management policy\n\nconfiguration management plan\n\nprocedures addressing least functionality in the information system\n\nsecurity plan\n\ninformation system design documentation\n\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nsecurity configuration checklists\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with security configuration management responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem\/network administrators"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational processes prohibiting or restricting functions, ports, protocols, and\/or services\n\nautomated mechanisms implementing restrictions or prohibition of functions, ports, protocols, and\/or services"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"cm-7.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Periodic Review","params":[{"id":"cm-7.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined frequency"},{"id":"cm-7.1_prm_2","label":"organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and services within the information system deemed to be unnecessary and\/or nonsecure"}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"cm-07.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-7.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.1_smt.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Reviews the information system {{ insert: param, cm-7.1_prm_1 }} to identify unnecessary and\/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and"},{"id":"cm-7.1_smt.b","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Disables {{ insert: param, cm-7.1_prm_2 }}."}]},{"id":"cm-7.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and\/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities.

Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission and\/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly\/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a

This control applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in

The second path (i.e., the out-of-band path) is used to independently verify the authentication and\/or requested action. For example, a user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires access, and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the server contacts the user via the user’s cell phone to verify that the requested action originated from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an individual on the telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The conditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in requested transactions.","links":[{"href":"#ia-10","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ia-11","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-37","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"ia-2.13_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ia-2.13_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"IA-2(13)[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines out-of-band authentication to be implemented by the information system;"},{"id":"ia-2.13_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"IA-2(13)[2]"}],"prose":"the organization defines conditions under which the information system implements organization-defined out-of-band authentication; and"},{"id":"ia-2.13_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"IA-2(13)[3]"}],"prose":"the information system implements organization-defined out-of-band authentication under organization-defined conditions."}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Identification and authentication policy\n\nprocedures addressing user identification and authentication\n\ninformation system design documentation\n\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\n\ninformation system audit records\n\nsystem-generated list of out-of-band authentication paths\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with information system operations responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with account management responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem\/network administrators\n\nsystem developers"}]},{"name":"assessment","props":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms supporting and\/or implementing out-of-band authentication capability"}]}]}]},{"id":"ia-3","class":"SP800-53","title":"Device Identification and Authentication","params":[{"id":"ia-3_prm_1","label":"organization-defined specific and\/or types of devices"},{"id":"ia-3_prm_2","select":{"how-many":"one-or-more","choice":["local","remote","network"]}}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"IA-3"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ia-03"}],"parts":[{"id":"ia-3_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates {{ insert: param, ia-3_prm_1 }} before establishing a {{ insert: param, ia-3_prm_2 }} connection."},{"id":"ia-3_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type\/device.

In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance.

Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric.

The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition.

Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item.

Security plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions\/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management\/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.","links":[{"href":"#ac-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-14","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-9","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cp-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ir-8","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#mp-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pl-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-1","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-8","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-11","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"pl-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"pl-2.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)"}],"prose":"develops a security plan for the information system that:","parts":[{"id":"pl-2.a.1_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(1)"}],"prose":"is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.2_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(2)"}],"prose":"explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.3_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(3)"}],"prose":"describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions and business processes;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.4_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(4)"}],"prose":"provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting rationale;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.5_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(5)"}],"prose":"describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships with or connections to other information systems;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.6_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(6)"}],"prose":"provides an overview of the security requirements for the system;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.7_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(7)"}],"prose":"identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.8_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(8)"}],"prose":"describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements including a rationale for the tailoring and supplemental decisions;"},{"id":"pl-2.a.9_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(a)(9)"}],"prose":"is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation;"}]},{"id":"pl-2.b_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-2.b_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines personnel or roles to whom copies of the security plan are to be distributed and subsequent changes to the plan are to be communicated;"},{"id":"pl-2.b_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(b)[2]"}],"prose":"distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes to the plan to organization-defined personnel or roles;"}]},{"id":"pl-2.c_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-2.c_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to review the security plan for the information system;"},{"id":"pl-2.c_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(c)[2]"}],"prose":"reviews the security plan for the information system with the organization-defined frequency;"}]},{"id":"pl-2.d_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(d)"}],"prose":"updates the plan to address:","parts":[{"id":"pl-2.d_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(d)[1]"}],"prose":"changes to the information system\/environment of operation;"},{"id":"pl-2.d_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(d)[2]"}],"prose":"problems identified during plan implementation;"},{"id":"pl-2.d_obj.3","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(d)[3]"}],"prose":"problems identified during security control assessments;"}]},{"id":"pl-2.e_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(e)"}],"prose":"protects the security plan from unauthorized:","parts":[{"id":"pl-2.e_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-2(e)[1]"}],"prose":"disclosure;

The information security architecture at the individual information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement\/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and any other specific protection needs. In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission\/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)\/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product\/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate\/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.","links":[{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-7","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"related"},{"href":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.6028\/NIST.SP.800-53r4","rel":"related"}]},{"id":"pl-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)"}],"prose":"develops an information security architecture for the information system that describes:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a.1_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(1)"}],"prose":"the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.2_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(2)"}],"prose":"how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the enterprise architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.3_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(3)"}],"prose":"any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external services;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to review and update the information security architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[2]"}],"prose":"reviews and updates the information security architecture with the organization-defined frequency to reflect updates in the enterprise architecture;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)"}],"prose":"ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.1","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[1]"}],"prose":"the security plan;"},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.2","name":"objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[2]"}],"prose":"the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS);
