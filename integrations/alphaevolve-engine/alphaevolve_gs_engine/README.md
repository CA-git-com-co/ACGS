# AlphaEvolve Governance System Engine

The AlphaEvolve Governance System Engine is a Python-based framework designed to manage, evolve, and validate governance structures for AI systems. It provides tools and data structures for defining constitutional principles, operational rules, handling amendments, and performing rigorous validation checks.

## Overview

As AI systems become more complex and autonomous, establishing robust governance mechanisms is crucial. AlphaEvolve aims to provide a dynamic and adaptive governance framework that can evolve alongside AI capabilities while ensuring safety, fairness, and alignment with human values.

This engine is the core component, offering:

- **Core Data Structures:** For representing foundational principles, specific operational rules, and proposed amendments.
- **Policy Synthesis:** Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in drafting and refining policies.
- **Multi-faceted Validation:** A suite of validators to check policies for syntactic correctness, semantic alignment, safety, potential biases, and internal conflicts.
- **Cryptographic Services:** For ensuring the integrity and authenticity of governance components.
- **Modularity:** Designed to be extensible, allowing for new validation techniques or synthesis methods to be integrated.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Governance Model:** Distinguishes between high-level Constitutional Principles and fine-grained Operational Rules.
- **Amendment Process:** Data structures to represent proposed changes to the governance framework.
- **LLM-Powered Policy Generation:** `LLMPolicyGenerator` assists human experts in drafting policies based on natural language goals.
- **Comprehensive Validation Suite:**
  - `SyntacticValidator`: Checks policy code (e.g., Rego) for syntax errors using tools like OPA.
  - `SemanticValidator`: Assesses if policies behave as intended using scenario-based testing.
  - `FormalVerifier`: (Interface with mock) For verifying policies against formal properties (future integration with SMT solvers/model checkers).
  - `SafetyValidator`: Identifies known unsafe patterns or simulates policies in safety-critical scenarios.
  - `BiasValidator`: Assesses policies for potential biases using statistical metrics or qualitative LLM reviews.
  - `ConflictValidator`: Detects contradictions or redundancies between different policies.
- **Utility Services:**
  - `LLMService`: Pluggable interface for various LLM backends (OpenAI, Mock provided).
  - `CryptoService`: Hashing and digital signature capabilities.
  - `Logging`: Standardized logging setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) executable installed and in your system's PATH (required for most validation features related to Rego policies).
- (Optional) OpenAI API key if you intend to use `OpenAILLMService`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd alphaevolve_gs_engine
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit `.env` to include your actual API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) or custom paths (e.g., `OPA_EXECUTABLE_PATH` if OPA is not in PATH).

### Running Examples

Navigate to the `examples` directory and run the provided scripts:

```bash
cd examples
python run_synthesis_example.py
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `LLMPolicyGenerator` to create a policy. It defaults to using a `MockLLMService`, so no API key is needed to run it initially.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, navigate to the project root directory (where `src` and `tests` are visible) and use the `unittest` module. Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` is set up to find the `src` directory if running tests from the root, or run from within the `src` directory for relative imports in tests to work easily. A common way from the project root:

```bash
# Ensure your PYTHONPATH includes the src directory, or run tests in a way that Python can find the modules.
# For example, if your project root is `alphaevolve_gs_engine_project/`:
# export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src # (Linux/macOS)
# set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%cd%\src # (Windows CMD)

python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Or, if your test files are structured to be run as scripts and handle their own imports (as the provided test files attempt to do by modifying `sys.path`):

```bash
# Example for a specific test file, assuming you are in the `tests` directory
# python core/test_data_structures.py
# (This might require test files to be executable and handle paths correctly)

# Using `unittest discover` from the project root is generally more robust if PYTHONPATH is set.
```

## Usage Overview

The engine's components can be imported and used in your Python applications.

```python
from alphaevolve_gs_engine.core.constitutional_principle import ConstitutionalPrinciple
from alphaevolve_gs_engine.services.policy_synthesizer import LLMPolicyGenerator, PolicySynthesisInput
from alphaevolve_gs_engine.services.llm_service import get_llm_service
from alphaevolve_gs_engine.services.validation.syntactic_validator import SyntacticValidator

# Initialize an LLM service (mock or real)
llm = get_llm_service("mock") # or "openai" if configured

# Create a policy synthesizer
synthesizer = LLMPolicyGenerator(llm_service=llm)

# Define a goal for a new policy
synthesis_input = PolicySynthesisInput(
    synthesis_goal="Create a Rego rule to allow read access to public documents.",
    policy_type="operational_rule",
    desired_format="rego",
    constraints=["Package must be 'public_access'."]
)

# Generate a policy suggestion
suggestion = synthesizer.synthesize_policy(synthesis_input)

if suggestion:
    print("Suggested Policy Code:")
    print(suggestion.suggested_policy_code)
    print("\nExplanation:")
    print(suggestion.explanation)

    # Validate the generated policy
    syntax_validator = SyntacticValidator()
    is_valid, message = syntax_validator.validate(suggestion.suggested_policy_code, language="rego")
    print(f"\nSyntax Validation: Valid = {is_valid}, Message = {message}")
else:
    print("Policy synthesis failed.")

```

## Key Components in Detail

### Core Data Structures

Located in `alphaevolve_gs_engine.core`:

- **`ConstitutionalPrinciple`**: Represents high-level, foundational rules. Attributes include ID, name, description, category, policy code (can be formal or natural language), version, and metadata.
- **`OperationalRule`**: Represents specific, actionable rules derived from principles. Attributes include ID, name, description, policy code (typically Rego), derivation links, activation status, version, and priority.
- **`Amendment`**: Represents proposed changes to principles or rules, including justification, status, and proposer details.

### Services

Located in `alphaevolve_gs_engine.services`:

- **`LLMService`**: Abstract base class for LLM interactions. `OpenAILLMService` and `MockLLMService` are provided implementations.
- **`CryptoService`**: Provides utilities like `hash_data` and methods for digital signatures using the `cryptography` library.
- **`PolicySynthesizer`**: Abstract base class for policy generation. `LLMPolicyGenerator` uses an LLM to draft policies based on `PolicySynthesisInput`.
- **Validation Services** (in `alphaevolve_gs_engine.services.validation`):
  - `SyntacticValidator`: Checks Rego policy syntax using OPA.
  - `SemanticValidator`: (e.g., `ScenarioBasedSemanticValidator`) Evaluates if policies behave as expected given specific inputs and expected outcomes. Uses OPA for Rego evaluation.
  - `FormalVerifier`: (Mock provided) Interface for formal verification against properties (e.g., using SMT solvers).
  - `SafetyValidator`: (e.g., `PatternBasedSafetyValidator`, `SimulationBasedSafetyValidator`) Checks for unsafe patterns or simulates policy effects in safety-critical scenarios.
  - `BiasValidator`: (e.g., `FairnessMetricValidator`, `LLMBiasReviewer`) Assesses policies for fairness and potential biases using statistical methods or LLM review.
  - `ConflictValidator`: (e.g., `OPAConflictDetector`) Identifies logical conflicts between different policies within the system.

## Disclaimer

This is a conceptual and research-oriented framework. While it aims to provide robust tools, its application in real-world, safety-critical AI systems should be approached with caution and rigorous independent verification. The effectiveness of LLM-based synthesis and review depends heavily on the models and prompts used.
