formal_verifier.py

This module defines the FormalVerifier, responsible for conducting formal
verification of policies against specified properties or invariants.
This often involves translating policies and properties into a formal
language understood by model checkers or SMT solvers.

Classes:
    FormalVerifier: Interface for formal verification.
    MockFormalVerifier: A mock implementation for testing.
    # Potentially, specific verifiers like:
    # OPASMTVerifier: Using OPA with SMT solvers (e.g., via `opa test --smt`).

# Note: A real implementation, e.g., OPASMTVerifier, would be complex.
# It might involve:
# 1. Setting up OPA with SMT capabilities (`opa test --smt config.yaml`).
# 2. Translating FormalVerificationProperty.formal_expression into Rego queries
#    that, when evaluated by `opa test --smt`, prove or disprove the property.
# 3. Parsing the output of `opa test --smt` to determine results.
# This requires significant infrastructure and is beyond a simple class structure here.
# For now, the MockFormalVerifier serves as a placeholder for this capability.
