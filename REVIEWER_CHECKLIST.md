# 📋 ACGS-PGP Applications Restructuring - Reviewer Checklist

## Overview
This checklist helps reviewers systematically validate the applications directory restructuring changes in PR #143.

## 🔍 Pre-Review Setup

### 1. Checkout the Feature Branch
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/applications-directory-restructuring
```

### 2. Run Automated Validation
```bash
python test_restructured_applications.py
```
**Expected Result**: All 6 tests should pass with 100% success rate.

## 📁 Directory Structure Review

### ✅ Verify New Structure
Check that the following directories exist and are properly organized:

- [ ] `applications/shared/` - New consolidated shared resources directory
- [ ] `applications/shared/components/` - Shared UI components
- [ ] `applications/shared/hooks/` - Shared React hooks
- [ ] `applications/shared/types/` - Shared TypeScript types
- [ ] `applications/governance-dashboard/src/` - Enhanced structure
- [ ] `applications/legacy-frontend/src/` - Enhanced structure

### ✅ Verify File Moves
Confirm these files were moved correctly (not copied):

- [ ] `components/dashboard/DashboardCards.tsx` → `shared/components/dashboard/`
- [ ] `components/layout/CommandBar.tsx` → `shared/components/layout/`
- [ ] `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` → `shared/components/layout/`
- [ ] `components/layout/ThemeToggle.tsx` → `shared/components/layout/`
- [ ] `components/ui/Button.tsx` → `shared/components/ui/`
- [ ] `components/ui/Card.tsx` → `shared/components/ui/`
- [ ] `components/ui/Input.tsx` → `shared/components/ui/`
- [ ] `hooks/useKeyboard.ts` → `shared/hooks/`
- [ ] `hooks/useLocalStorage.ts` → `shared/hooks/`
- [ ] `types/governance.ts` → `shared/types/`

### ✅ Verify Old Locations Cleaned Up
Confirm these directories no longer exist at root level:

- [ ] `applications/components/` (should be removed)
- [ ] `applications/hooks/` (should be removed)
- [ ] `applications/types/` (should be removed)

## 🔧 Microservice Integration Review

### ✅ Service Files Preserved
Verify all microservice integration files are intact:

#### Governance Dashboard Services
- [ ] `governance-dashboard/src/services/ACService.js`
- [ ] `governance-dashboard/src/services/GSService.js`
- [ ] `governance-dashboard/src/services/AuthService.js`
- [ ] `governance-dashboard/src/services/IntegrityService.js`
- [ ] `governance-dashboard/src/services/PublicConsultationService.js`

#### Legacy Frontend Services
- [ ] `legacy-frontend/src/services/ACService.js`
- [ ] `legacy-frontend/src/services/GSService.js`
- [ ] `legacy-frontend/src/services/AuthService.js`
- [ ] `legacy-frontend/src/services/IntegrityService.js`
- [ ] `legacy-frontend/src/services/PublicConsultationService.js`

### ✅ API Integration Patterns
Check that service files still contain proper patterns:

- [ ] `import api from './api'` statements preserved
- [ ] CSRF token handling intact
- [ ] Environment variable usage maintained
- [ ] Error handling patterns preserved

## 📦 Build System Review

### ✅ Configuration Files Preserved
Verify all configuration files remain at proper locations:

- [ ] `applications/package.json` - Root package configuration
- [ ] `applications/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- [ ] `applications/next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- [ ] `applications/tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- [ ] `applications/postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- [ ] `governance-dashboard/package.json` - App-specific config
- [ ] `legacy-frontend/package.json` - App-specific config

### ✅ Test Build Process (Optional)
If you want to test builds:

```bash
cd applications/governance-dashboard
npm install
npm run build

cd ../legacy-frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

## 📝 Code Quality Review

### ✅ Import Statements
Check for any problematic import patterns:

- [ ] No broken imports due to file moves
- [ ] Relative imports updated where necessary
- [ ] No circular dependencies introduced

### ✅ Component References
Verify components can still be imported:

- [ ] Shared components accessible from both applications
- [ ] Type definitions properly exported
- [ ] Hook functions properly exported

## 🧪 Functional Testing

### ✅ Manual Verification
If possible, test key functionality:

- [ ] Applications can start without errors
- [ ] Shared components render correctly
- [ ] Service integrations work properly
- [ ] Authentication flows function

## 📋 Documentation Review

### ✅ New Documentation
Review the added documentation:

- [ ] `APPLICATIONS_RESTRUCTURING_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] `restructure_applications.py` - Well-documented script
- [ ] PR description - Clear and detailed

### ✅ Script Quality
Review the restructuring script:

- [ ] `print_summary` method properly implemented
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Validation logic thorough
- [ ] Dry-run functionality works

## 🚀 ACGS-PGP Framework Compliance

### ✅ Naming Conventions
- [ ] Components use PascalCase (e.g., `PolicyProposal.tsx`)
- [ ] Services use camelCase with "Service" suffix (e.g., `ACService.js`)
- [ ] Hooks use camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useKeyboard.ts`)

### ✅ File Organization
- [ ] Services in `/src/services/` directories
- [ ] Components in `/src/components/` directories
- [ ] Pages in `/src/pages/` directories
- [ ] Shared resources in `/shared/` directory

### ✅ Integration Requirements
- [ ] Centralized service modules maintained
- [ ] Authentication patterns preserved
- [ ] API communication patterns intact
