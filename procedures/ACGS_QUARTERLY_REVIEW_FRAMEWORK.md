3. **Emergency Fix**: Implement immediate remediation if needed
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate why issue wasn't caught earlier
5. **Process Improvement**: Update review procedures to prevent recurrence

### Review Delays
If quarterly review cannot be completed on schedule:
1. **Notification**: Inform all stakeholders within 24 hours
2. **Rescheduling**: Set new completion date within 2 weeks

Every quarterly review must verify:
- [ ] Constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` present in all documentation
- [ ] No constitutional violations in any documentation changes
- [ ] All system configurations maintain constitutional compliance
- [ ] Review process itself follows constitutional governance principles
