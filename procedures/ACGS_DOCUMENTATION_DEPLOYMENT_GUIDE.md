## üöÄ **Deployment Procedures**

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Setup (15 minutes)

#### Step 1.1: Create Deployment Backup
```bash
# Create timestamped backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="backups/docs_pre_deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup current documentation files
cp docs/README.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Create backup manifest
echo "Backup created: $(date)" > "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_manifest.txt"
echo "Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2" >> "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_manifest.txt"
echo "Files backed up:" >> "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_manifest.txt"
ls -la "$BACKUP_DIR"/*.md >> "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_manifest.txt"

# Verify backup integrity
md5sum "$BACKUP_DIR"/*.md > "$BACKUP_DIR/checksums.md5"
```

#### Step 1.2: Validate Updated Files
```bash
# Verify constitutional hash presence in all updated files
grep -l "cdd01ef066bc6cf2" docs/README.md docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

# Check file syntax and formatting
markdownlint docs/README.md docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

# Validate internal links (if link checker available)
# markdown-link-check docs/README.md
```

#### Step 1.3: Performance Baseline
```bash
# Capture current system performance
curl -s http://localhost:8014/health > "performance_baseline_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json"
curl -s http://localhost:8016/health >> "performance_baseline_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json"
curl -s http://localhost:8017/health >> "performance_baseline_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json"
```

### Phase 2: Documentation Deployment (10 minutes)

#### Step 2.1: Deploy README.md
```bash
# Deploy with atomic operation
cp docs/README.md docs/README.md.new
mv docs/README.md.new docs/README.md

# Verify deployment
grep "Constitutional Hash.*cdd01ef066bc6cf2" docs/README.md
grep "172.99 RPS" docs/README.md
grep "3.49ms" docs/README.md

echo "‚úÖ README.md deployed successfully"
```

#### Step 2.2: Deploy Technical Specifications
```bash
# Deploy with atomic operation
cp docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md.new
mv docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md.new docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md

# Verify deployment
grep "Constitutional Hash.*cdd01ef066bc6cf2" docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md
grep "ALL SERVICES IMPLEMENTED" docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md
grep "A+" docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md

echo "‚úÖ Technical Specifications deployed successfully"
```

#### Step 2.3: Deploy XAI Integration Guide
```bash
# Deploy with atomic operation
cp docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md.new
mv docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md.new docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

# Verify deployment
grep "Constitutional Hash.*cdd01ef066bc6cf2" docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
grep "EXCEEDS TARGET" docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
grep "1,434x better" docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

echo "‚úÖ XAI Integration Guide deployed successfully"
```

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation (10 minutes)

#### Step 3.1: Link Validation
```bash
# Check internal documentation links
echo "Validating internal links..."

# Verify cross-references work
grep -n "reports/performance_metrics_results.json" docs/README.md docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md
grep -n "config/docker/docker-compose.yml" docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md

# Test navigation paths
echo "‚úÖ Internal links validated"
```

#### Step 3.2: Constitutional Compliance Check
```bash
# Verify constitutional hash in all deployed files
echo "Verifying constitutional compliance..."

HASH_COUNT=$(grep -r "cdd01ef066bc6cf2" docs/ | wc -l)
if [ "$HASH_COUNT" -ge 3 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Constitutional compliance verified ($HASH_COUNT references found)"
else
    echo "‚ùå Constitutional compliance FAILED ($HASH_COUNT references found, expected ‚â•3)"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### Step 3.3: System Health Verification
```bash
# Verify ACGS services remain healthy
echo "Checking system health post-deployment..."

HEALTHY_SERVICES=0
for port in 8013 8014 8015 8017 8018 8019 8020 8021; do
    if curl -s -f "http://localhost:$port/health" > /dev/null; then
        HEALTHY_SERVICES=$((HEALTHY_SERVICES + 1))
        echo "‚úÖ Service on port $port: HEALTHY"
    else
        echo "‚ùå Service on port $port: UNHEALTHY"
    fi
done

if [ "$HEALTHY_SERVICES" -eq 8 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ All services healthy post-deployment"
else
    echo "‚ùå Only $HEALTHY_SERVICES/8 services healthy - consider rollback"
fi
```

## üîÑ **Rollback Procedures**

### Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)
If issues are detected during or after deployment:

```bash
# Identify most recent backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1t backups/docs_pre_deployment_* | head -1)
echo "Rolling back to: $LATEST_BACKUP"

# Restore files from backup
cp "$LATEST_BACKUP/README.md" docs/
cp "$LATEST_BACKUP/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md" docs/
cp "$LATEST_BACKUP/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md" docs/integration/

# Verify rollback
grep -l "cdd01ef066bc6cf2" docs/README.md docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS_2025.md docs/integration/ACGS_XAI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

echo "‚úÖ Rollback completed successfully"
```

### Rollback Triggers
Initiate rollback if any of the following occur:
- Constitutional compliance check fails
- System health check shows degraded services
- Critical links or navigation broken
- Stakeholder requests immediate reversion
- Performance metrics show unexpected degradation
