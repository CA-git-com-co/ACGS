# ACGS-1 Phase 2 Systematic Remediation - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: ACGS-1 Phase 2 Systematic Remediation Workflow
**Timeline**: 4-24 hours (Target: <4 hours)
**Priority**: Critical System Recovery
**Status**: In Progress

## Executive Summary

Execute Phase 2 of the systematic remediation workflow for the ACGS-1 governance system to resolve high priority issues and restore full operational capability. Based on Phase 1 analysis that identified Docker container "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'" as the root cause for 4/7 service failures, implement a structured three-priority approach to achieve >99.5% system availability.

## Problem Statement

The ACGS-1 governance system is experiencing critical service failures:
- **Current State**: 43% service availability (3/7 services operational)
- **Root Cause**: Docker container dependency issues and missing Python modules
- **Impact**: GS service cannot connect to AC and Integrity services
- **Risk**: Constitutional governance workflows are non-functional

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives (Must Have)
1. **Service Availability**: Achieve 100% (7/7) service operational status
2. **Performance**: Maintain <2s response times and >99.5% uptime
3. **Critical Dependencies**: Restore GS ↔ AC ↔ Integrity service connectivity
4. **Constitutional Compliance**: Functional AC ↔ PGC service integration
5. **WINA Oversight**: Active EC service coordination with batch operations
6. **Zero Regression**: Preserve all existing Quantumagi deployment capabilities

### Secondary Objectives (Should Have)
1. **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete policy synthesis → compliance → oversight
2. **Performance Optimization**: <0.01 SOL per governance action cost
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and alerting
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive validation reports

## Technical Requirements

### Priority 1: Complete Service Restoration (0-2 hours)
**Objective**: Restore all 4 failed services to operational status

**Requirements**:
- Stop failing Docker containers (acgs_ac_service, acgs_integrity_service, acgs_fv_service, acgs_gs_service)
- Deploy services using host-based approach with localhost networking
- Verify each service starts successfully and responds on correct ports
- Achieve service availability increase from 43% (3/7) to 100% (7/7)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 7 services return HTTP 200 status on health endpoints
- Response times <2 seconds for all services
- Comprehensive system health check passes

### Priority 2: Service Integration and Reliability (2-8 hours)
**Objective**: Establish functional service integration and redundancy

**Requirements**:
- **WINA Oversight Activation**: Configure EC service coordination endpoints
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Establish AC ↔ PGC service communication
- **Service Redundancy**: Implement health monitoring and automatic restart
- **Authentication**: Configure development bypass for testing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WINA oversight coordination endpoints accessible
- Constitutional compliance validation workflow functional
- Service health monitoring operational
- Authentication bypass configuration active

### Priority 3: Production Readiness Validation (8-24 hours)
**Objective**: Validate system readiness for production deployment

**Requirements**:
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete governance workflows operational
- **Performance Validation**: Sustained load testing >1 hour
- **System Integration**: Service mesh and inter-service communication
- **Compliance Workflows**: Full constitutional governance validation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Policy synthesis → constitutional compliance → oversight workflows functional
- Performance targets maintained under load
- Service discovery and network connectivity verified
- Constitutional compliance validation active

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2 Execution Plan

**Decision Point**: Host-based deployment (recommended) vs Docker image rebuild
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Host-based deployment (30 min implementation)
- **Option B (Alternative)**: Docker image rebuild (1-2 hours implementation)

**Execution Approach**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Stop failing containers and deploy host-based services
2. **Validation**: Execute comprehensive health checks after each priority
3. **Integration**: Test service-to-service communication and workflows
4. **Documentation**: Generate detailed validation reports

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Shared Module Dependencies**: Python import failures
2. **Service Discovery**: Network connectivity between services
3. **Performance Degradation**: Resource utilization under load
4. **Quantumagi Regression**: Blockchain integration preservation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Dependency Isolation**: Use minimal service implementations
2. **Network Simplification**: Localhost-based service communication
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting
4. **Backup Strategy**: Preserve original configurations

## Monitoring and Validation

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Service Availability**: Target >99.5% (Currently 43%)
- **Response Times**: Target <2s (Currently variable)
- **Error Rates**: Target <1% (Currently high for 4 services)
- **Uptime**: Target >99.5% sustained operation

### Validation Framework
1. **Health Checks**: Automated endpoint monitoring
2. **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service communication
3. **Load Testing**: Performance under concurrent requests
4. **Compliance Testing**: Constitutional governance workflows

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- Python 3.12 environment with uvicorn
- FastAPI framework for service implementation
- Docker containers for existing working services
- Localhost networking for service communication

### Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: Must complete within 4-24 hour window
- **Availability**: Minimize downtime during remediation
- **Compatibility**: Preserve Quantumagi blockchain functionality
- **Testing**: Maintain development environment capabilities

## Deliverables

### Phase 2 Outputs
1. **Operational Services**: 7/7 services healthy and responsive
2. **Integration Framework**: Functional service-to-service communication
3. **Monitoring System**: Health checks and performance metrics
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive validation and status reports
5. **Configuration**: Authentication and security settings for development

### Success Validation
- Comprehensive system health report showing 100% availability
- Performance metrics demonstrating <2s response times
- Integration tests confirming service communication
- Constitutional compliance workflow validation
- Quantumagi deployment functionality verification

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Phase 2:
1. **Phase 3 Planning**: Advanced feature implementation
2. **Production Deployment**: Migration to production environment
3. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tuning and scaling
4. **Documentation**: User guides and operational procedures

## Conclusion

Phase 2 systematic remediation is critical for restoring ACGS-1 governance system functionality. Success will enable continued development and eventual production deployment while maintaining the existing Quantumagi constitutional governance capabilities.
