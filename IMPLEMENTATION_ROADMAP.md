CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_principles_priority_category ON principles(priority_weight, category);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_timestamp ON audit_logs(created_at);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_policy_rules_status ON policy_rules(status, created_at);
```

### Caching Strategy

    "principle_queries": {"ttl": 1800, "max_size": 500},
    "verification_results": {"ttl": 7200, "max_size": 200}
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```yaml
# Prometheus metrics
metrics:
  - name: acgs_request_duration_seconds
    type: histogram
    help: Request duration in seconds
  - name: acgs_llm_inference_duration_seconds
    type: histogram
