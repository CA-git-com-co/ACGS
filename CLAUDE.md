### Consensus Engine

The Consensus Engine service is responsible for resolving conflicts between multiple AI agents. It implements a variety of consensus algorithms to facilitate agreement and decision-making.

**Core Functionality:**

*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Provides a framework for agents to resolve disagreements and reach a consensus.
*   **Algorithm Variety:** Supports multiple consensus mechanisms, allowing for flexible and context-aware conflict resolution.
*   **Blackboard Integration:**  Leverages the Blackboard Service to share information and knowledge between agents during the consensus process.
*   **Constitutional Compliance:**  Ensures that all consensus outcomes adhere to the system's constitutional principles, enforced by the constitutional hash (`cdd01ef066bc6cf2`).

**Available Consensus Algorithms:**

*   `MajorityVoteConsensus`
*   `WeightedVoteConsensus`
*   `RankedChoiceConsensus`
*   `ConsensusThresholdConsensus`
*   `HierarchicalOverrideConsensus`
*   `ConstitutionalPriorityConsensus`
*   `ExpertMediationConsensus`

**Workflow:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Conflict Identified] --> B{Consensus Engine};
    B --> C[Initiate Consensus Session];
    C --> D{Select Algorithm};
    D --> E[Cast Votes];
    E --> F{Execute Consensus};
    F --> G{Consensus Reached?};
    G -- Yes --> H[Resolve Conflict];
    G -- No --> I[Escalate or Retry];
    H --> J[Update Blackboard];
    I --> J;
```

### Governance Synthesis

The Governance Synthesis service is the core of the ACGS policy and governance framework. It utilizes an advanced Open Policy Agent (OPA) engine to evaluate, and synthesize governance decisions based on a comprehensive set of policies.

**Core Functionality:**

*   **Advanced OPA Engine:**  Integrates with a real OPA server for robust and flexible policy evaluation.
*   **Multi-Policy Orchestration:**  Evaluates and synthesizes decisions from a wide range of policy types, including:
    *   Constitutional
    *   Regulatory
    *   Procedural
    *   Security
    *   Evolutionary
    *   Data Governance
    *   Multi-Tenant
    *   Agent Lifecycle
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Detects and resolves conflicts between different policies to ensure consistent and coherent governance.
*   **Audit Trails:**  Generates detailed audit trails for all governance decisions, ensuring transparency and accountability.
*   **Constitutional Compliance:**  Enforces the system's constitutional principles, validated by the constitutional hash (`cdd01ef066bc6cf2`).

**Decision-Making Process:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Governance Synthesis Engine};
    B --> C[Determine Applicable Policies];
    C --> D[Evaluate Policies using OPA];
    D --> E{Detect Conflicts};
    E -- Yes --> F[Resolve Conflicts];
    E -- No --> G[Synthesize Final Decision];
    F --> G;
    G --> H[Return Decision];
```

### Multi-Agent Coordinator

The Multi-Agent Coordinator is a sophisticated service that orchestrates the collaboration of multiple AI agents to address complex governance requests. It employs a hybrid hierarchical-blackboard policy, combining a structured agent hierarchy with a flexible knowledge-sharing system.

**Core Functionality:**

*   **Hybrid Coordination Model:**  Utilizes a unique coordination model that includes:
    *   **Hierarchical Agent Structure:**  Organizes agents into a three-tiered hierarchy (Orchestrator, Domain Specialist, Worker) to manage tasks of varying complexity.
    *   **Blackboard System:**  Employs a blackboard for agents to share knowledge, post tasks, and track progress.
*   **Dynamic Task Decomposition:**  Breaks down high-level governance requests into a series of smaller, well-defined tasks.
*   **Adaptive Hierarchy Creation:**  Dynamically constructs an appropriate agent hierarchy based on the complexity and requirements of each governance request.
*   **Constitutional Safety:**  Integrates with the Constitutional Safety Validator to ensure all coordinated activities adhere to the system's constitutional principles (`cdd01ef066bc6cf2`).
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Includes mechanisms to detect and resolve conflicts that may arise between agents during collaboration.

**Hierarchical Coordination Model:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Governance Request] --> B{Multi-Agent Coordinator};
    B --> C{Create Agent Hierarchy};
    C --> D[Orchestrator];
    D --> E[Domain Specialists];
    E --> F[Worker Agents];
    F --> G[Execute Tasks];
    G --> H{Blackboard};
    H --> B;
```

### Worker Agents

The Worker Agents service is a collection of specialized agents that perform the core analysis and assessment tasks required for governance. Each agent is an expert in a specific domain, and they work under the direction of the Multi-Agent Coordinator.

**Specialized Agents:**

*   **Ethics Agent:**  This agent is responsible for conducting in-depth ethical analysis. Its tasks include:
    *   **Bias Assessment:**  Detecting and evaluating demographic and algorithmic bias.
    *   **Fairness Evaluation:**  Assessing the fairness of models and their outcomes.
    *   **Harm Assessment:**  Identifying and analyzing potential harms to individuals and society.
*   **Legal Agent:**  This agent ensures that all activities and decisions comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Its responsibilities include:
    *   **Regulatory Compliance:**  Analyzing compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA, and the EU AI Act.
    *   **Jurisdiction Analysis:**  Evaluating legal requirements across different jurisdictions.
    *   **Contractual Compliance:**  Ensuring adherence to contractual obligations and service level agreements (SLAs).
*   **Operational Agent:**  This agent focuses on the practical aspects of deploying and managing AI systems. Its key functions include:
    *   **Operational Validation:**  Verifying that systems meet operational requirements.

## Key Development Patterns

### Service Structure

Each service follows this pattern:

```
services/{core|platform_services}/service_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py           # FastAPI application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas.py        # Pydantic models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py         # Database models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/              # API endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- All services support multi-tenancy via `services/shared/middleware/tenant_middleware.py`
- Database isolation using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security
- JWT-based authentication with tenant context
- Shared utilities in `services/shared/`

### Import Patterns for Services

Services use conditional imports for shared components:

```python
try:
    from services.shared.middleware.tenant_middleware import (
        TenantContextMiddleware,
        get_tenant_context,
    )
    MULTI_TENANT_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    MULTI_TENANT_AVAILABLE = False
```

### Error Handling

Use standardized error handling from `services/shared/middleware/error_handling.py`:

- `ConstitutionalComplianceError`
- `SecurityValidationError`
- `setup_error_handlers(app)`

## Performance Targets

The system maintains these performance standards:

- **Throughput**: â‰¥1000 RPS (Current: 1200+ RPS)
- **Latency**: P99 â‰¤ 5ms (Current: 3.49ms)
- **Requests per second**: 172.98
- **Cache hit ratio**: 100%
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 85%+ (Current: 100%)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: â‰¥95% (Current: 97% Verified)
- **Availability**: 99.99% (Current: Continuous monitoring)

## Documentation and Validation Tools

The repository includes sophisticated documentation validation tools:

```bash
# Enhanced validation framework (consolidates all validators)
python3 tools/validation/unified_documentation_validation_framework.py

# Individual validators
python3 tools/validation/enhanced_validation.py
python3 tools/validation/advanced_cross_reference_analyzer.py
python3 tools/validation/api_code_sync_validator.py

# Auto-generate missing documentation
python3 tools/automation/enhanced_auto_doc_generator.py
```

## Database Migrations

Database operations use Alembic with multi-tenant support:

```bash
cd services/shared
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"
alembic upgrade head
```

## Service Health Checks

All services provide standardized endpoints:

- `/health` - Service health status
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `/api/v1/` - API endpoints

```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8002/health
curl http://localhost:8010/health
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

Production deployment uses Kubernetes manifests in `infrastructure/kubernetes/`:

- Complete auto-scaling configuration
- Multi-tenant security policies
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Constitutional compliance validation

## Multi-Agent Coordination with MCP Integration

### MCP Server Stack Integration

The ACGS system now includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server stack for enhanced multi-agent coordination:

#### MCP Services Architecture
- **MCP Aggregator** (port 3000): Central coordination hub for all MCP services
- **Filesystem MCP** (port 3001): File system operations with constitutional compliance
- **GitHub MCP** (port 3002): GitHub API integration with governance validation
- **Browser MCP** (port 3003): Headless browser operations for web-based tasks

#### Integration with Existing ACGS Services
The MCP stack integrates seamlessly with existing ACGS services:

```bash
# Start MCP coordination stack alongside ACGS services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d  # MCP services (ports 3000-3003)
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.acgs.yml up -d  # ACGS services (ports 8001-8016)

# Validate MCP-ACGS integration
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # MCP Aggregator
curl http://localhost:8008/health  # Multi-Agent Coordinator
curl http://localhost:8010/health  # Blackboard Service
```

#### Constitutional Compliance Integration
All MCP services maintain constitutional compliance with hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`:

- **Constitutional Validation**: All MCP operations validated against ACGS constitutional framework
- **Audit Integration**: MCP actions logged through ACGS Integrity Service (port 8002)
- **Performance Monitoring**: MCP metrics integrated with ACGS monitoring stack
- **Security Enforcement**: MCP services use ACGS Authentication Service (port 8016)

#### Claude Integration Patterns
The MCP stack enhances Claude integration through:

1. **Structured Communication**: MCP protocol provides standardized agent communication
2. **Tool Orchestration**: MCP tools available to Claude agents through the aggregator
3. **Constitutional Oversight**: All Claude-MCP interactions validated for compliance
4. **Performance Optimization**: Sub-5ms P99 latency maintained across MCP-Claude coordination
