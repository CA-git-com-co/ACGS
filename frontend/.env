# Define API URLs for the services
# These will be used by the React app at build time.
# When running with docker-compose, these should point to the service names and ports
# as defined in docker-compose.yml.
# Since the frontend is served by Node/Serve and accessed via browser,
# these URLs must be accessible from the user's machine (e.g. localhost pointing to mapped ports).

# To make React Router work correctly with Dockerized serve, if public_url is not '.',

# PUBLIC_URL=.

# Optional: Node path for Create React App scripts if issues arise with imports outside src/
