Generic single-database configuration for ACGS-PGP.

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts and configuration.
Alembic is used to manage PostgreSQL database schema migrations.

Key files:
- `env.py`: Runtime configuration for Alembic. It's set up to read the
             DATABASE_URL from environment variables and to recognize
             models defined in `shared/models.py`.
- `script.py.mako`: Template for new migration scripts.
- `versions/`: Contains individual migration scripts.

To create a new migration (after changing models in `shared/models.py`):
  docker-compose exec alembic-runner alembic revision -m "your_migration_message" --autogenerate

To apply migrations:
  docker-compose exec alembic-runner alembic upgrade head

Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file (for the `alembic-runner` service)
points to the correct PostgreSQL database.
