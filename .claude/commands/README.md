# Claude Commands for ACGS-2 Project Organization

This directory contains Claude-specific commands and specifications for optimizing the ACGS-2 project structure.

## Available Commands

### 1. Project Structure Organization

#### `organize-project-structure.md`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive design specification for reorganizing the ACGS-2 project structure.

**What it addresses**:
- Root directory cleanup (200+ files → <20)
- Service architecture standardization
- Duplicate code consolidation (16 duplicate scripts)
- Dependency management (22 requirements files → 6 shared)
- Documentation organization

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Complete analysis of current issues
- ✅ Detailed reorganization plan with phases
- ✅ Success criteria and metrics
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Implementation timeline

#### `execute-reorganization.sh`
**Purpose**: Automated implementation script based on the design specification.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Preview changes (recommended first)
./.claude/commands/execute-reorganization.sh --dry-run

# Execute reorganization
./.claude/commands/execute-reorganization.sh

# Get help
./.claude/commands/execute-reorganization.sh --help
```

**What it does**:
- ✅ Creates standardized directory structure
- ✅ Moves misplaced files to appropriate locations
- ✅ Consolidates duplicate scripts and tools
- ✅ Creates shared dependency structure
- ✅ Updates .gitignore for new organization
- ✅ Generates comprehensive report
- ✅ Creates backup before changes

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
1. Read the design specification: `organize-project-structure.md`
2. Review current project structure issues
3. Understand the proposed solutions

### Phase 2: Preview Changes
```bash
# See what would change without making modifications
./.claude/commands/execute-reorganization.sh --dry-run
```

### Phase 3: Create Backup
The script automatically creates timestamped backups, but you can also:
```bash
# Manual backup
cp -r . ../ACGS-2-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Phase 4: Execute Reorganization
```bash
# Run the full reorganization
./.claude/commands/execute-reorganization.sh
```

### Phase 5: Validation
1. Check that all services still function
2. Verify documentation links work
3. Test dependency resolution
4. Run CI/CD pipelines

## Expected Results

### Before Reorganization
- **Root directory**: 200+ scattered files
- **Duplicate scripts**: 16 copies across directories
- **Requirements files**: 22 with version conflicts
- **Documentation**: Fragmented across locations
- **Project size**: 6.3GB with unnecessary files

### After Reorganization
- **Root directory**: <20 essential files
- **Duplicate scripts**: 0 (consolidated and categorized)
- **Requirements files**: 6 shared, standardized files
- **Documentation**: Organized hierarchical structure
- **Project structure**: Clear architectural boundaries

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert the reorganization:

1. **Using the backup**:
   ```bash
   # Find your backup directory
   ls -la backup-*
   
   # Restore from backup
   cp -r backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/* .
   ```

2. **Using git**:
   ```bash
   # Reset to pre-reorganization state
   git reset --hard HEAD~1  # If changes were committed
   git clean -fdx           # Remove untracked files
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services fail to start after reorganization**
   - Check that shared requirements are accessible
   - Verify import paths are updated
   - Review service-specific requirements

2. **Documentation links broken**
   - Update relative paths in documentation
   - Check cross-references between docs
   - Verify README links

3. **CI/CD pipeline failures**
   - Update build scripts for new structure
   - Modify Docker file paths
   - Update test discovery patterns

### Getting Help

1. Review the design specification for detailed explanations
2. Check the reorganization report for specific changes made
3. Use `--dry-run` mode to preview changes before applying
4. Restore from backup if needed

## Benefits of Reorganization

✅ **Improved Maintainability**: Clear structure with consistent patterns
✅ **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidated scripts and dependencies  
✅ **Better Documentation**: Organized, discoverable information
✅ **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Faster onboarding and navigation
✅ **Cleaner CI/CD**: Simplified build and deployment processes
✅ **Reduced Technical Debt**: Eliminated scattered files and configs
