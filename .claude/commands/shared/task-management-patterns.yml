## Two-Tier Architecture

```yaml
Task_Management_Hierarchy:
  Level_1_Tasks: "High-level features (./claudedocs/tasks/ folders)"
    Purpose: "Session persistence, git branching, requirement tracking"
    Scope: "Features spanning multiple sessions"
    Examples: ["build auth system", "implement dashboard", "create API"]
    Format: "Comprehensive markdown files w/ full context"
    
  Level_2_Todos: "Immediate actionable steps (TodoWrite/TodoRead)"
    Purpose: "Real-time execution tracking within session"
    Scope: "Current session specific actions"
    Examples: ["Update user.js", "Add validation", "Write test"]
    Format: "JSON objects w/ status tracking"

Integration_Flow:
  Task_Creation: "User request → Task breakdown → Todo generation"
  Session_Start: "Scan tasks → Load context → Generate todos"
  Progress_Sync: "Todo completion → Task progress update"
  Session_End: "Save context → Update task status"
```

## Auto-Trigger Detection Patterns

```yaml
Complexity_Triggers:
  File_Count_Thresholds:
    Single_File: "No auto-trigger needed"
    Multiple_Files_3_5: "Consider TodoList if operations are interdependent"
    Many_Files_6_Plus: "AUTO-TRIGGER TodoList for coordination"
    
  Operation_Complexity:
    Simple_Commands: "Read, analyze single file → No todos"
    Multi_Step_Workflows: "Build, test, deploy sequence → Auto-trigger"
    Cross_Component_Changes: "Multiple modules affected → Auto-trigger"
    Architecture_Changes: "System-wide impact → Auto-trigger"
    
  Time_Estimation_Triggers:
    Quick_Tasks_Under_5_Min: "Direct execution, no todos"
    Medium_Tasks_5_30_Min: "Consider todos for tracking"
    Long_Tasks_Over_30_Min: "AUTO-TRIGGER todos for management"
    
  Risk_Level_Triggers:
    Low_Risk: "Documentation, simple fixes → Optional todos"
    Medium_Risk: "Feature additions, refactoring → Recommend todos"
    High_Risk: "Database changes, deployments → REQUIRE todos"
    Critical_Risk: "Security, production → MANDATORY todos + checkpoints"

Auto_Trigger_Rules:
  Command_Patterns:
    build + multiple_targets: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Coordination needed"
    migrate + database: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Risk management required"
    deploy + production: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Safety protocols"
    refactor + architecture: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Complexity management"
    
  Context_Patterns:
    Multiple_Repos: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Cross-repo coordination"
    Team_Collaboration: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Progress visibility"
    Learning_New_Tech: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Learning progress tracking"
    Debug_Complex_Issue: "AUTO-TRIGGER: Investigation steps"
```

## UltraCompressed Task Template

```yaml
UltraCompressed_Task_Format:
  Header: "T: {TASK_TITLE} | ID: {TASK_ID} | S: {STATUS} | P: {PRIORITY} | Branch: {BRANCH}"
  
  Essential_Phases:
    Analysis: "□ Requirements & design"
    Implementation: "□ Core functionality"
    Testing: "□ Unit & integration"
    Deployment: "□ Staging & prod"
    
  Critical_Context:
    Decisions: "{KEY_DECISIONS}"
    Blockers: "{BLOCKERS}"
    Progress: "{COMPLETED}/{TOTAL} ({PERCENTAGE}%)"
    
  Workflow_State:
    Current_Focus: "{ACTIVE_TODO}"
    Next_Action: "{NEXT_LOGICAL_STEP}"
    Risk_Level: "{LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL}"

Compression_Patterns:
  Status_Codes: "P(Pending) | IP(InProgress) | B(Blocked) | C(Completed) | A(Archived)"
  Priority_Codes: "C(Critical) | H(High) | M(Medium) | L(Low)"
  Phase_Symbols: "□(pending) | ⏳(in-progress) | ⚠(blocked) | ✅(completed)"
  
Token_Optimization:
  Standard_Format: "~200-300 tokens per task"
  UltraCompressed: "~50-80 tokens per task"
  Reduction_Rate: "70-75% token savings"
  Information_Density: "Higher concentration of actionable data"
```

## Task Lifecycle Management

```

## Todo Integration Patterns

```yaml

  completed: "Finished successfully"
  blocked: "Cannot proceed (capture blocker info)"
  
Todo_Lifecycle_Hooks:
  On_Todo_Start: "Mark in_progress, update task context"
  On_Todo_Complete: "Mark completed, advance task progress"
  On_Todo_Block: "Capture blocker, update task status"
  On_Phase_Complete: "Generate next phase todos"

Real_Time_Synchronization:
  Todo_Changes: "Immediately update task progress"
  Task_Updates: "Regenerate relevant todos"
  Context_Changes: "Update both task & todo context"
  Session_Breaks: "Preserve state in both systems"
```

## Advanced Task Management

```yaml
Multi_Task_Coordination:
  Concurrent_Tasks:

```

## Intelligent Workflow Patterns

  Pattern_Detection:
    Feature_Development: "analyze → design → build → test → deploy"
    Bug_Investigation: "troubleshoot → analyze → fix → test → verify"
    Quality_Improvement: "scan → analyze → improve → test → document"
    Research_Task: "research → experiment → document → implement"
    
  Auto_Phase_Generation:
    Feature_Tasks: "Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment"
    Bug_Tasks: "Investigation → Root Cause → Fix → Verification → Documentation"
    Refactor_Tasks: "Analysis → Planning → Implementation → Testing → Integration"
    
Success_Pattern_Learning:
  Effective_Sequences: "Track successful task completion patterns"
  Time_Estimation: "Learn from actual vs estimated durations"

```

## Integration with Command System

Progress_Visibility:
  Command_Progress: "Show task progress in command outputs"
  Task_Dashboard: "Integrated view of tasks & todos"
  Session_Summary: "End-of-session progress report"
```

## Error Recovery & Resilience

```yaml
Task_Recovery_Scenarios:
  Partial_State_Recovery:
    Task_Only: "Task file exists, todos missing → regenerate todos"
    Todos_Only: "Todos exist, task missing → continue with warning"
    Corrupted_Task: "Parse recoverable portions, prompt for missing"
    Git_Mismatch: "Task branch missing → offer branch creation"
    
  Fallback_Strategies:
    Manual_Recovery: "Present recovery options to user"
    Fresh_Start: "Option to abandon recovery, start new"
    Partial_Import: "Import recoverable data, start fresh for rest"
    Checkpoint_Rollback: "Restore from last known good state"

Task_Validation:
  Integrity_Checks: "Verify task structure & required fields"
  Context_Completeness: "Ensure critical context elements present"
  Progress_Consistency: "Validate todo progress vs task progress"
  Git_Alignment: "Verify git state matches task expectations"
```
