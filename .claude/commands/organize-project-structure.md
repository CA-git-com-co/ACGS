# ACGS-2 Project Structure Organization & Optimization Prompt

## Context
The ACGS-2 (Advanced Constitutional Governance System) project requires comprehensive file organization and structure optimization to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and establish clear architectural boundaries.

## Current Issues Identified

### Root Directory Chaos (Priority 1)
- 200+ files in root directory lacking organization
- Mixed documentation, configuration, and executable files
- No clear separation of concerns
- Reports and temporary files scattered throughout

### Duplicate Code & Files (Priority 1)
- 16 duplicate Python scripts across `/scripts` and `/tools`
- Multiple requirements.txt files (22 total) with overlapping dependencies
- Duplicate configuration files across services
- 610 Python files with print statements (should use logging)
- 54 files with commented-out code blocks

### Service Architecture Issues (Priority 2)
- Inconsistent service structure patterns
- Mixed domain boundaries
- Shared code scattered across services
- No clear dependency management strategy

### Documentation Fragmentation (Priority 2)
- Multiple README files with overlapping content
- Documentation scattered across root and subdirectories
- No clear information architecture
- Inconsistent documentation standards

## Design Objectives

### 1. Root Directory Organization
Create a clean, scannable root directory with clear purpose for each top-level item:

```
/home/dislove/ACGS-2/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Primary project overview
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md                 # Version history
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE                      # Legal
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml              # Main Python project config
â”œâ”€â”€ uv.lock                     # Dependency lock file
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile                    # Build automation
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml          # Primary compose file
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                  # VCS ignore rules
â”œâ”€â”€ config/environments/developmentconfig/environments/example.env                # Environment template
â”œâ”€â”€ 
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                       # All documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ services/                   # Microservices code
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                    # Automation & tooling
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                      # Test suites
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/             # Infrastructure as code
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                     # Configuration templates
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                       # Data files & schemas
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                      # Development tools
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/                    # Generated reports (gitignored)
â”œâ”€â”€ temp/                       # Temporary files (gitignored)
â””â”€â”€ .claude/                    # Claude-specific commands
```

### 2. Service Architecture Standardization
Establish consistent patterns for all services:

```
services/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                     # Shared libraries & utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/             # Common middleware
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/                 # Shared data models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                  # Utility functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/                 # Shared configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ requirements/           # Consolidated dependencies
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-base.txt
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-dev.txt
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ requirements-test.txt
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                       # Core business services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constitutional-ai/      # Constitutional validation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ governance-synthesis/   # Policy synthesis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ multi-agent-coordinator/# Agent coordination
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [other-core-services]/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ platform/                  # Platform services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-gateway/           # API routing & auth
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ authentication/       # Identity management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integrity/            # Audit & compliance
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [other-platform-services]/
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ integration/               # External integrations
    â”œâ”€â”€ blockchain/           # Blockchain integration
    â”œâ”€â”€ mcp/                 # Model Context Protocol
    â””â”€â”€ [other-integrations]/
```

### 3. Duplicate Code Consolidation Strategy

#### Script Consolidation
```
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ setup/                     # Initial setup & installation
â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/               # Deployment automation
â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/               # Health checks & monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ testing/                  # Test automation
â”œâ”€â”€ maintenance/              # Cleanup & maintenance
â””â”€â”€ development/              # Development utilities

tools/                        # Remove - merge into scripts/
```

#### Dependency Consolidation
```
services/shared/requirements/
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-base.txt     # Core dependencies (FastAPI, etc)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-web.txt      # Web-specific dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-data.txt     # Database & storage
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-security.txt # Security & crypto
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-dev.txt      # Development tools
â””â”€â”€ requirements-test.txt     # Testing frameworks

# Service requirements become minimal:
services/[service]/requirements.txt:
-r ../shared/requirements/requirements-base.txt
-r ../shared/requirements/requirements-web.txt
# Add only service-specific dependencies here
```

### 4. Documentation Architecture
```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Documentation index
â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started/          # Quick start guides
â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/             # System design
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                      # API documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/               # Infrastructure guides
â”œâ”€â”€ development/              # Developer guides
â”œâ”€â”€ security/                 # Security documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ troubleshooting/          # Common issues
â””â”€â”€ research/                 # Research materials
```

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- Root directory files: 200+ â†’ <20
- Duplicate scripts: 16 â†’ 0
- Requirements files: 22 â†’ 6 (shared structure)
- Documentation files: Consolidated 80%
- Project disk usage: Reduced by 1GB+

### Qualitative Improvements
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent architecture patterns
- Unified dependency management
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Improved developer experience
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better CI/CD pipeline efficiency

## Implementation Commands

Execute this reorganization through the following sequence:

```bash
# 1. Create new directory structure
mkdir -p docs/{getting-started,architecture,api,deployment,development,security,troubleshooting}
mkdir -p scripts/{setup,deployment,monitoring,testing,maintenance,development}
mkdir -p services/shared/requirements
mkdir -p temp reports

# 2. Move files to appropriate locations
# (Specific moves based on file analysis)

# 3. Consolidate dependencies
# (Create shared requirements files)

# 4. Update service structures
# (Migrate services to new pattern)

# 5. Clean up duplicates
# (Remove duplicate files and merge functionality)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- Create comprehensive backup before changes
- Use git branches for incremental changes
- Test critical services after each phase

### Validation Steps
- Verify all services still function after moves
- Check dependency resolution
- Validate documentation links
- Test CI/CD pipelines

### Rollback Plan
- Maintain original structure in separate branch
- Document all changes for easy reversal
- Test rollback procedures

This reorganization will transform ACGS-2 into a well-structured, maintainable project with clear architectural boundaries and reduced technical debt.
