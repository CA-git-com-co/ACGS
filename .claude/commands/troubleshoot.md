## Troubleshooting Approach

**1. Reproduce:** Isolate minimal reproduction | Document steps | Verify consistency | Capture full context

**2. Gather Evidence:** Error messages & stack traces | Logs & metrics | System state | Recent changes | Environment differences

**3. Form Hypotheses:** Most likely causes | Alternative explanations | Test predictions | Rule out possibilities

**4. Test & Verify:** Targeted experiments | Change one variable | Document results | Confirm root cause

**5. Fix & Prevent:** Implement solution | Add tests | Document fix | Prevent recurrence

## Common Issue Categories

**Performance:** Slow queries | Memory leaks | CPU bottlenecks | Network latency | Inefficient algorithms

**Crashes/Errors:** Null references | Type mismatches | Race conditions | Memory corruption | Stack overflow

**Integration:** API failures | Authentication issues | Version conflicts | Configuration problems | Network timeouts

**Data Issues:** Corruption | Inconsistency | Migration failures | Encoding problems | Concurrency conflicts
