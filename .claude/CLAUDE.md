# CLAUDE.md - ACGS-SuperClaude Integration for Warp Drive

This file provides enhanced guidance to Claude integrating SuperClaude's specialized development framework with ACGS's constitutional AI governance, optimized for Warp Drive knowledge sharing and collaboration.

## Warp Drive Integration Overview

This configuration enables seamless integration with Warp Drive's knowledge and collaboration features:
- **Shareable Knowledge**: All command patterns and personas are documented for team sharing
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Multi-agent coordination patterns designed for team environments
- **Knowledge Base**: Constitutional compliance framework serves as reusable organizational knowledge
- **Team Onboarding**: Standardized commands and personas for consistent team development practices

## Constitutional Compliance (CRITICAL)
**IMMUTABLE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS** validate constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` in all agent communications
- **NEVER** bypass constitutional compliance validation for any operation
- **ALWAYS** implement pre-execution, runtime, and post-execution compliance checks
- **ESCALATE** to human oversight immediately for constitutional violations

## Multi-Agent Coordination Guidelines

### Agent Communication Patterns
- Use hierarchical coordination: Claude agents for strategic planning, OpenCode agents for execution
- Implement document-based communication following MetaGPT assembly line paradigm
- Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) for Claude agent integration with services
- Follow A2A (Agent2Agent) protocol for external framework interoperability
- Maintain complete audit trail for all agent interactions
- **ALL COMMUNICATIONS MUST INCLUDE constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`**

### Warp Drive Collaboration Patterns
- **Knowledge Blocks**: Each SuperClaude command is documented as a reusable knowledge block
- **Team Templates**: Constitutional personas serve as shareable team development templates
- **Workflow Documentation**: All coordination patterns are documented for team knowledge sharing
- **Best Practices Library**: Constitutional compliance framework provides organizational standards
- **Onboarding Guides**: Standardized command patterns facilitate new team member integration

### Performance Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **P99 Latency**: <5ms for coordination operations, <2ms for cached decisions
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS for task handoffs between agents
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% for constitutional decisions and agent capabilities
- **Constitutional Compliance Rate**: 100% (no exceptions)
- **Escalation Response**: <30 seconds for human-in-the-loop triggers

   ```

2. **Persona Workflows**: Create role-specific templates
   ```bash
   # Security Review Template
   /load → /scan --security --persona-security → /analyze --vulnerabilities → /document --security
   ```

3. **Constitutional Standards**: Share compliance patterns
   ```bash
   # Constitutional Validation Template
   /constitutional-validate --hash cdd01ef066bc6cf2 → /analyze → /deploy
   ```
