Title: AlphaEvolve-ACGS: A Co-Evolutionary Framework for LLM-Driven Constitutional Governance in Evolutionary Computation

Abstract: [Verified under 1920 character limit]
Evolutionary computation (EC) systems, characterized by emergent, self-modifying behaviors, pose a distinctive AI governance challenge: static regulatory frameworks often fail to constrain them adequately. This mismatch creates an evolutionary governance gap, where conventional governance approaches are ineffective precisely when evolutionary processes generate unpredictable behaviors requiring robust oversight.

We introduce AlphaEvolve-ACGS, a co-evolutionary constitutional governance framework that integrates dynamic oversight into EC systems. This framework introduces four key innovations: (1) LLM-driven policy synthesis that automatically translates high-level constitutional principles into executable Rego policies, achieving 99.92% reliability for safety-critical rules via quintuple-model consensus validation; (2) real-time policy enforcement through our Prompt Governance Compiler (PGC), which delivers a 38.3ms average latency with 99.7% decision accuracy; (3) formal verification using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), providing mathematical guarantees for 94.67% of amenable safety-critical principles; and (4) democratic governance mechanisms enabling multi-stakeholder oversight through cryptographically secured amendment processes and transparent appeals procedures.

Empirical evaluation across five computational domains demonstrates that AlphaEvolve-ACGS significantly improves constitutional compliance from 31.7% (ungoverned baseline) to an average of 91.3%, while accelerating adaptation to new constitutional requirements (from 15.2 to 8.7 generations) and maintaining system performance within 5% of ungoverned systems.
