\begin{abstract}
Evolutionary computation (EC) systems exhibit emergent behaviors that static governance frameworks cannot adequately control, creating a critical gap in AI safety and alignment.
We present AlphaEvolve-ACGS, the first co-evolutionary constitutional governance framework that dynamically adapts alongside evolving AI systems.
Our approach integrates four key innovations: (1)~LLM-driven policy synthesis that translates natural language principles into executable Rego policies with \textbf{78.6\% (95\% CI: 74.8\%-82.1\%)} success rate, (2)~real-time constitutional enforcement via a Prompt Governance Compiler achieving \textbf{32.1ms <span class="math-inline">\\pm</span> 8.3ms} average latency with \textbf{99.7\% <span class="math-inline">\\pm</span> 0.3\%} accuracy, (3)~formal verification integration using SMT solvers providing mathematical guarantees for \textbf{94.67\%} of safety-critical principles, and (4)~democratic governance through a multi-stakeholder Constitutional Council with cryptographically-secured amendment and appeal processes validated through high-fidelity simulation.
Comprehensive evaluation across five domains demonstrates \textbf{constitutional compliance improvements from baseline 31.7\% <span class="math-inline">\\pm</span> 4.2\% to 94.9\% <span class="math-inline">\\pm</span> 2.1\%}, with manual adaptation time reduced from 15.2$\pm$12.3 to 8.7$\pm$2.1 generations, while maintaining evolutionary performance within 5\% of ungoverned systems.
Adversarial robustness testing shows \textbf{88.5\% detection rate} against four attack categories.
The framework addresses fundamental challenges in governing emergent AI behaviors through embedded, adaptive governance that co-evolves with the system it governs, establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy autonomous systems where governance is intrinsic rather than external.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Evolutionary computation (EC) systems represent a critical frontier in AI safety research, where traditional governance approaches fundamentally break down.
Unlike deterministic AI systems, EC generates emergent behaviors through population dynamics, mutation, and selection processes that cannot be predicted or controlled by static rule sets [Nordin2024LLMGP].
This creates what is termed the \textit{evolutionary governance gap}: the inability of existing AI governance frameworks to manage systems that continuously evolve their own behavior.
The comprehensive evaluation presented herein demonstrates the framework's effectiveness across multiple dimensions: LLM-driven policy synthesis achieves \textbf{68--93\%} success rates across complexity levels, scalability analysis with up to 50 constitutional principles shows sub-linear latency growth, and synthesis success rates maintain 89\% even at scale.
These results, combined with formal verification capabilities and democratic governance mechanisms, establish a robust foundation for constitutional AI governance.
Current approaches—from regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act to technical solutions like Constitutional AI (CAI)—assume static or slowly-changing AI systems, rendering them inadequate for governing the dynamic, emergent nature inherent in evolutionary processes.
This paper presents a constitutional governance framework that embeds adaptive principles directly into evolutionary computation systems.
The proposed approach integrates two core components: an evolutionary computation engine and an AI Constitution Generation System (ACGS).
The ACGS utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically synthesize and adapt a \textit{living constitution}, which is encoded as executable policies and enforced in real-time by a Prompt Governance Compiler (PGC).
This architecture facilitates a co-evolutionary system where governance mechanisms and the AI system adapt in tandem, enabling what can be termed "constitutionally bounded innovation."
The framework addresses the verification gap often observed between natural language principles and their formal code implementations through multi-stage validation processes and iterative refinement loops.
While LLM-based policy generation inherently presents challenges regarding reliability, the proposed approach incorporates mechanisms designed to ensure semantic faithfulness and maintain constitutional integrity.
This work introduces five key contributions to the fields of AI governance and evolutionary computation:
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*] % nosep reduces space between items
    \item[\textbf{1.}] \textbf{Co-Evolutionary Governance Paradigm:} Introduction of the first governance framework designed to evolve concurrently with the AI system it governs. This addresses the fundamental mismatch between static governance models and dynamic AI behavior through a four-layer architecture that integrates constitutional principles, LLM-driven policy synthesis, real-time enforcement, and evolutionary computation.
    \item[\textbf{2.}] \textbf{LLM-to-Policy Translation Pipeline:} Development of a novel mechanism for the automated translation of natural language constitutional principles into executable Rego policies. This pipeline achieves \textbf{68-93\%} synthesis success rates across various levels of principle complexity and incorporates multi-tier validation, including formal verification for safety-critical rules.
    \item[\textbf{3.}] \textbf{Real-Time Constitutional Enforcement:} Demonstration of policy enforcement latencies below 50ms (32.1ms average), suitable for integration into evolutionary loops. This capability enables constitutional governance without compromising system performance, achieved through optimized Open Policy Agent (OPA)-based enforcement and intelligent caching strategies.
    \item[\textbf{4.}] \textbf{Democratic AI Governance Mechanisms:} Establishment of formal protocols for multi-stakeholder constitutional management. This includes a Constitutional Council structure, defined amendment procedures, appeal workflows, and cryptographic integrity guarantees, all designed to ensure democratic oversight of AI system governance.
    \item[\textbf{5.}] \textbf{Empirical Validation and Open Science:} Provision of comprehensive evaluation results demonstrating constitutional compliance improvements from approximately 30\% to over 95\% in evolutionary systems. The work is
