## 3. Multi-Model Consensus Framework

### 3.1 Model Selection and Validation Architecture

**Primary Models**:
- GPT-4-turbo: Constitutional prompting and primary synthesis
- Claude-3.5-Sonnet: Adversarial validation and edge case detection
- Cohere Command-R+: Logical consistency verification
- Gemini Pro: Semantic similarity validation
- Local Fine-tuned Model: Domain-specific validation

**Consensus Mechanism**:
```python
class UltraReliableConsensus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = self._initialize_model_ensemble()
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.999  # 99.9% confidence requirement
        self.semantic_threshold = 0.95     # Semantic similarity threshold
        
    async def achieve_ultra_reliable_consensus(
        self,
        principle: ConstitutionalPrinciple,
        context: SynthesisContext
    ) -> UltraReliableResult:
        """Achieve >99.9% reliable policy synthesis through consensus."""
        
        # Stage 1: Multi-model synthesis
        synthesis_results = await self._parallel_synthesis(principle, context)
        
        # Stage 2: Cross-validation matrix
        validation_matrix = await self._cross_validate_results(synthesis_results)
        
        # Stage 3: Semantic consistency check
        semantic_scores = await self._validate_semantic_consistency(
            synthesis_results, principle
        )
        
        # Stage 4: Formal verification where applicable
        formal_verification = await self._attempt_formal_verification(
            synthesis_results, principle
        )
        
        # Stage 5: Consensus decision
        consensus = await self._weighted_consensus_decision(
            validation_matrix, semantic_scores, formal_verification
        )
        
        if consensus.confidence >= self.confidence_threshold:
            return UltraReliableResult(
                policy=consensus.policy,
                confidence=consensus.confidence,
                validation_path="automated_consensus",
                requires_human_review=False
            )
        else:
            return await self._escalate_to_expert_review(
                synthesis_results, principle, consensus
            )
```

### 3.2 Confidence Scoring and Uncertainty Quantification

**Uncertainty Sources**:
1. Model disagreement variance
2. Semantic ambiguity in principles
3. Context-dependent interpretation uncertainty
4. Domain-specific knowledge gaps

## 4. Semantic Faithfulness Validation Protocol

### 4.1 Principle Complexity Classification

**Complexity Taxonomy**:
- **Level 1 (Simple)**: Direct operational constraints (e.g., "no division operator")
- **Level 2 (Moderate)**: Conditional logic with clear parameters (e.g., "fairness thresholds")

        policy: str,
        principle: ConstitutionalPrinciple
    ) -> SemanticValidationResult:
        """Expert validation for highly complex principles."""
        
        # Multi-expert review with consensus requirement
        expert_reviews = await self._collect_expert_reviews(policy, principle)
        
        # Semantic similarity analysis
        embedding_similarity = await self._calculate_embedding_similarity(
            policy, principle.description
        )
        
        # Logical consistency check
        logical_consistency = await self._verify_logical_consistency(
            policy, principle.constraints
        )
        
        # Expert consensus analysis
        expert_consensus = await self._analyze_expert_consensus(expert_reviews)
        
        return SemanticValidationResult(
            complexity_level=4,
            embedding_similarity=embedding_similarity,
            logical_consistency=logical_consistency,
            expert_consensus=expert_consensus,
            overall_confidence=self._calculate_overall_confidence(
                embedding_similarity, logical_consistency, expert_consensus
            ),
            validation_path="expert_review"
        )
```
