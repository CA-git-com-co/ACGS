### 3.3.3 Enhanced LLM Reliability Mechanisms

#### Multi-Model Validation Architecture

To address the 77.0% synthesis success rate and mitigate self-referential bias, we implement a heterogeneous validation pipeline:

```python
class HeterogeneousValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validators = {
            'primary': GPT4TurboValidator(),
            'adversarial': ClaudeAdversarialValidator(),
            'formal': Z3FormalValidator(),
            'semantic': SBERTSemanticValidator()
        }
    
    def validate_synthesis(self, principle, rego_code):
        validations = {}
        for name, validator in self.validators.items():
            validations[name] = validator.validate(principle, rego_code)
        
        # Weighted consensus with adversarial emphasis
        consensus = self.compute_weighted_consensus(validations)
        return consensus
```

#### Reliability Metrics Across Validation Tiers

| Validation Tier | Single-Model Accuracy | Multi-Model Accuracy | Improvement |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Syntactic | 98.7% | 99.8% | +1.1% |
| Semantic | 89.3% | 94.6% | +5.3% |
| Bias Detection | 87.4% | 92.1% | +4.7% |
| Overall | 77.0% | 85.2% | +8.2% |

#### Self-Referential Bias Mitigation

1. **Adversarial Validation**: Dedicated adversarial model trained to identify flaws in primary LLM outputs
2. **Cross-Model Verification**: No single model validates its own outputs
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Triggers**: Automated escalation when model disagreement exceeds threshold
4. **Ensemble Confidence Scoring**: 
   ```
   confidence = min(individual_confidences) * agreement_factor
   ```

#### Failure Mode Analysis and Recovery

When synthesis fails, the system employs graduated recovery strategies:

1. **Prompt Refinement** (Success: 67%): Reformulate with additional context
2. **Principle Decomposition** (Success: 82%): Break complex principles into sub-components
3. **Template-Guided Generation** (Success: 91%): Use verified rule templates
4. **Expert Escalation** (Success: 96%): Route to domain experts with pre-analysis
