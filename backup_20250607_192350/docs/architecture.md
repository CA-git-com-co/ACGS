# ACGS-PGP System Architecture

## 1. Overview

The AI Compliance Governance System - Policy Generation Platform (ACGS-PGP) is a comprehensive microservices-based architecture implementing constitutional AI governance through three development phases. The system facilitates the creation, management, verification, and audit of AI governance policies with constitutional grounding, formal verification, and cryptographic integrity.

### Implementation Status

## 4. Constitutional Council Governance Mechanisms

The Constitutional Council serves as the democratic governance framework within the ACGS-PGP system, ensuring that all AI policies and system operations align with established constitutional principles. Its role extends beyond simple oversight to active participation in the evolution and enforcement of the system's foundational rules.

### **Role and Responsibilities**
*   **Constitutional Amendment Proposals:** Members can propose changes or additions to the core constitutional principles, meta-rules, and governance guidelines.
*   **Voting and Ratification:** Utilizes secure, transparent voting mechanisms to ratify proposed amendments, ensuring broad consensus and democratic legitimacy.
*   **Dispute Resolution Oversight:** Provides an appeals and dispute resolution mechanism for conflicts arising from policy interpretations or enforcement actions.
*   **Principle Interpretation:** Offers authoritative interpretations of constitutional principles in ambiguous or novel scenarios, guiding policy synthesis and verification.
*   **System Audits and Reviews:** Conducts periodic audits of the system's compliance with constitutional mandates and recommends necessary adjustments.

### **Interaction with Other Components**
*   **Authentication Service (`auth_service`):** Manages the identity and roles of Constitutional Council members, ensuring secure access and voting privileges.
*   **Audit & Compliance Service (`ac_service`):** Directly interacts with the `ac_service` for managing constitutional principles, meta-rules, and the amendment workflow. All proposals and voting records are managed here.
*   **Frontend Service:** Provides a dedicated portal for Council members to propose amendments, participate in discussions, cast votes, and view audit trails of governance decisions.
*   **Integrity & Verifiability Service (`integrity_service`):** Ensures the cryptographic integrity and immutability of all Council decisions, amendment records, and voting results, providing an auditable history.

## 5. Communication Flow

*   **API Gateway (Conceptual):** While not explicitly implemented as a separate service in the initial setup, in a production environment, an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Traefik, Nginx Plus) would typically sit in front of the backend microservices. It would handle:
    *   Request routing to the appropriate service.
    *   Load balancing.
    *   Authentication (validating JWT tokens).
    *   Rate limiting.
    *   SSL termination.
    *   For the current setup, the frontend `apiClient` and Docker Compose/Kubernetes service definitions manage direct service communication or routing.

*   **Inter-service Communication:**
    *   Services communicate with each other via RESTful APIs (HTTP/JSON).
    *   Synchronous communication is typical for direct requests.
    *   Asynchronous communication (e.g., via a message queue like RabbitMQ or Kafka) could be introduced for tasks like triggering formal verification or complex policy generation steps to improve responsiveness, but is not part of the initial core design.
    (Future Enhancement: A detailed sequence diagram illustrating key interaction flows will be added in a future update.)
