# ACGS-1 Reorganized Architecture

## Overview

The ACGS-1 reorganization implements a clean separation of concerns with blockchain-first architecture, following Solana and Rust ecosystem best practices while maintaining integration with the AlphaEvolve constitutional AI framework.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Blockchain-First Design**
- Solana programs as the source of truth for governance state
- Off-chain services provide synthesis and validation
- On-chain enforcement ensures immutable governance

### 2. **Microservices Architecture**
- Domain-driven service boundaries
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Clear API contracts between services

### 3. **Event-Driven Integration**
- Blockchain events drive off-chain processing
- Asynchronous communication between services
- Real-time governance state synchronization

## Component Architecture
