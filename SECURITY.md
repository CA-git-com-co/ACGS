# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to ensuring the security of the ACGS-P GP framework. Security updates and support are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

As the project is under active development, we recommend always using the latest stable release or the `main` branch for the most up-to-date security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us privately to protect the project and its users.

Please email us at `[Project Security Contact Email]` with a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any potential impact. We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1.  **Confirmation:** We will confirm the vulnerability and determine its potential impact.
2.  **Fix Development:** We will work on a fix for the vulnerability.
3.  **Release:** We will release a patch or new version that addresses the vulnerability.
4.  **Disclosure:** Once the fix is available, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability, typically through our project's release notes or a dedicated security advisory. We aim to coordinate disclosure with you to ensure responsible reporting.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will acknowledge your contribution where appropriate.
