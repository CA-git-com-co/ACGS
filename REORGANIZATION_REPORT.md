- **Script files:** ~350 properly organized scripts
- **Requirements files:** 7 consolidated shared requirements
- **Duplicate functionality:** Eliminated
- **Organization:** Clear separation of concerns

## Reorganization Actions Completed

### Phase 1: Root Directory Cleanup ✅
- **Moved 200+ files** to appropriate directories
- **Created standardized structure** with clear purposes
- **Organized reports** into `/reports/` directory
- **Consolidated temporary files** into `/temp/` directory
- **Moved configuration files** to `/config/` directory

### Phase 2: Script Consolidation ✅
- **Eliminated 40% duplication** in script files
- **Organized scripts** into functional categories:
  - `/scripts/setup/` - Installation and initialization
  - `/scripts/deployment/` - Production deployment
  - `/scripts/monitoring/` - Health checks and monitoring
  - `/scripts/testing/` - Test automation
  - `/scripts/maintenance/` - Cleanup and maintenance
  - `/scripts/development/` - Development utilities
  - `/scripts/security/` - Security hardening and validation

### Phase 3: Requirements Consolidation ✅
- **Reduced 45+ requirements files** to 7 shared requirements
- **Created consolidated structure** in `/services/shared/requirements/`:
  - `requirements-base.txt` - Core utilities
  - `requirements-web.txt` - Web framework dependencies
  - `requirements-core.txt` - AI/ML and core ACGS dependencies
  - `requirements-security.txt` - Security dependencies
  - `requirements-monitoring.txt` - Monitoring and observability
  - `requirements-analysis.txt` - Code analysis and testing
  - `requirements-consolidated.txt` - All-in-one reference

### Phase 4: Documentation Organization ✅
- **Maintained existing structure** in `/docs/` (already well-organized)
- **Enhanced documentation index** with comprehensive navigation
- **Organized by domain**:
  - `/docs/architecture/` - System design and architecture
  - `/docs/deployment/` - Deployment and operations
  - `/docs/development/` - Development guidelines
  - `/docs/security/` - Security documentation
  - `/docs/api/` - API documentation
  - `/docs/troubleshooting/` - Problem resolution
  - `/docs/research/` - Research materials

## Service Structure Analysis

### Current Service Organization
The analysis revealed the following service structure:

```
services/
├── core/                  # Core AI governance services
│   ├── constitutional-ai/
│   ├── governance-synthesis/
│   ├── multi-agent-coordinator/
│   └── [other core services]
├── platform_services/    # Platform infrastructure
│   ├── api-gateway/
│   ├── authentication/
│   ├── integrity/
│   └── [other platform services]
├── shared/               # Shared utilities and requirements
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── requirements/
│   └── [other shared components]
└── [other service categories]
```

### Identified Improvements
1. **Services needing structure standardization** - 5 services
2. **Services requiring FastAPI template compliance** - 8 services
