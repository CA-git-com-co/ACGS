## Performance Requirements

### ACGS-2 Performance Targets
- **P99 Latency**: <5ms (constitutional requirement)
- **Throughput**: >100 RPS (minimum operational standard)  
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% (efficiency requirement)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2)

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection via Prometheus
- Automated alerting on threshold violations
- Continuous validation of constitutional compliance
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD

### Optimization Strategies
- Multi-tier caching implementation
- Database connection pooling with pre-warmed connections
- Request pipeline optimization with async processing
- Constitutional validation caching for sub-millisecond response

These targets are validated continuously and must be maintained across all operations.
