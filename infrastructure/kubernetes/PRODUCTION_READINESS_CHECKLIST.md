## Validation Commands

### System Health Check

```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
./infrastructure/kubernetes/validate-deployment.sh

# Expected output: All validation steps passed
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run load testing
./infrastructure/kubernetes/load-test.sh --concurrent-users 20 --duration 300s

# Expected: >95% success rate, <2s response time
```

### Constitutional Compliance Check

```bash
# Check constitutional compliance metrics
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n acgs-system &
# Query: constitutional_compliance_score > 0.95
```

### Emergency Shutdown Test

```bash
# Test emergency shutdown capability (dry run)
kubectl get deployments -n acgs-system
# Verify all deployments can be scaled to 0 within 30 minutes
```
