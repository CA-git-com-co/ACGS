For example:\n                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches\n                  HTTPRoutes   that have either not specified any hostnames, or have\n                  specified at   least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                  \  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified\n                  at least   one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

For example,\n                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified\n                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must\n                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute\n                  have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,\n                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted.

This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with\n                  2 notable exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may\n                  be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard    label\n                  must appear by itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified\n                  by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting\n                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:\n                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches\n                  HTTPRoutes   that have either not specified any hostnames, or have\n                  specified at   least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                  \  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified\n                  at least   one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For\n                  example,   `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`\n                  would   all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net`\n                  would   not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard\n                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that\n                  a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`,\n                  and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. \n If both the\n                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames\n                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,\n                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified\n                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must\n                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute\n                  have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,\n                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted.
