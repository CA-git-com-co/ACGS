# ACGS-2 Terraform Infrastructure Directory Documentation
<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

## Directory Overview

The `infrastructure/terraform` directory contains comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform for the ACGS-2 constitutional AI governance platform. This directory provides cloud infrastructure provisioning, environment management, and resource orchestration achieving P99 <5ms performance and >100 RPS throughput across cloud deployments.

The Terraform infrastructure maintains constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` validation throughout all infrastructure operations while providing scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure for constitutional AI governance with enterprise-grade reliability and multi-environment support.
