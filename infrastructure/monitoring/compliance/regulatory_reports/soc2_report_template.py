Independent Service Auditor's Report

We have examined management's assertion that the controls within ACGS Constitutional AI's
system were effective throughout the period {period_start.strftime("%B %d, %Y")} to
{period_end.strftime("%B %d, %Y")}, to provide reasonable assurance that the Trust Service
Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy
(applicable trust services criteria) were achieved.

Constitutional Compliance Assessment:
The system maintains constitutional compliance through formal verification methods and
cryptographic audit trails. The constitutional hash {CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH} has been
verified throughout the examination period.

Opinion:
In our opinion, management's assertion that the controls within ACGS Constitutional AI's
system were effective throughout the period {period_start.strftime("%B %d, %Y")} to
{period_end.strftime("%B %d, %Y")}, to provide reasonable assurance that the applicable
trust services criteria were achieved is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Constitutional Verification:
All controls have been evaluated for constitutional compliance and formal verification
integrity. The system maintains democratic governance principles and human dignity
protections as verified by hash {CONSTITUTIONAL_HASH}.
