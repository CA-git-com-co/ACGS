## 🚀 Operational Readiness

### ✅ Ready for Use
- **Blockchain Operations**: Full constitutional governance capability
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: All programs responsive
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Framework active and validated
- **Data Integrity**: Audit trail and logging operational

### 🔄 Requires Service Startup
- **Policy Synthesis**: Start GS service for policy generation
- **Compliance Checking**: Start PGC service for real-time validation
- **Formal Verification**: Start FV service for mathematical proofs
- **Event Coordination**: Start EC service for workflow orchestration

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start ACGS Services**: Launch remaining 4 services for full integration
   ```bash
   # Start core governance services
   ./scripts/start-acgs-services.sh
   ```

2. **Validate Full Integration**: Re-run validation after service startup
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-quantumagi-integration.sh
   ```

3. **Test Governance Workflows**: Execute end-to-end governance operations
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-governance-workflows.sh
   ```

### Ongoing Monitoring
1. **Real-time Dashboard**: Use Quantumagi Validation Dashboard for continuous monitoring
