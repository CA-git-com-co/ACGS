## 🔍 **Critical Issues Resolved**

### 1. **Service Path Mismatches** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Before**: Workflows referenced non-existent `services/core/ac_service`, `gs_service`, etc.
- **After**: Updated to actual project structure with `services/` and `services/core/ec_service/`

### 2. **Missing Rust/Anchor Pipeline** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Before**: No blockchain development support in CI
- **After**: Comprehensive Rust/Anchor build, test, and validation pipeline

### 3. **Incorrect Directory References** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Before**: Workflows failed due to missing directories
- **After**: All paths validated and updated to match actual project structure

### 4. **Missing Solana CLI Setup** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Before**: No Solana development environment in CI
- **After**: Full Solana CLI v1.18.22 and Anchor CLI v0.29.0 setup

### 5. **YAML Parsing Issues** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Before**: Validation script couldn't parse workflow triggers
- **After**: Fixed PyYAML parsing quirks for proper validation

### 6. **Missing Configuration Files** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Before**: quantumagi_core missing package.json and Anchor.toml
- **After**: Created proper configuration files for all projects
