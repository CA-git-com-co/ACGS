## Overview

This document describes the security hardening implemented across all ACGS services.

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation
- **XSS Protection**: All string inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Comprehensive pattern detection
- **Command Injection Prevention**: System command pattern blocking
- **Path Traversal Protection**: File path validation
- **LDAP Injection Prevention**: LDAP query sanitization

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Request Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-minute limits
- **Burst Protection**: Additional burst capacity
- **IP-based Tracking**: Per-client tracking and enforcement

### 3. CSRF Protection
- **Token-based Protection**: Secure token generation and validation
- **Session Integration**: Token tied to user sessions
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired token removal

### 4. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP enforcement
- **XSS Protection Headers**: Browser XSS filtering
- **Frame Options**: Clickjacking prevention
- **Content Type Options**: MIME type sniffing prevention

### 5. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Whitelist-based file type checking
- **Magic Number Validation**: Content verification
- **Size Limits**: Configurable file size limits
- **Filename Sanitization**: Secure filename handling

## Usage

### Automatic Integration

Security middleware is automatically applied to all services through the standardized integration:

```python
from middleware_integration import apply_acgs_security_middleware

# Automatically applied during service startup
environment = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")
apply_acgs_security_middleware(app, "service-name", environment)
```

### Manual Validation

For endpoint-specific validation:

```python
from middleware_integration import validate_request_body, SecurityLevel

# Validate request body
sanitized_data = validate_request_body(request_data, SecurityLevel.HIGH)
```

### Security Monitoring

Monitor security metrics:

```bash
curl http://service:port/security/metrics
curl http://service:port/security/health
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
RATE_LIMIT_BURST=200

# CSRF protection
CSRF_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-csrf-key

# Security level
SECURITY_LEVEL=production  # or development
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: More permissive settings for easier testing
- **Production**: Strict security enforcement

## Security Levels

1. **LOW**: Basic sanitization
2. **MEDIUM**: Standard security validation (default)
3. **HIGH**: Strict validation with aggressive sanitization
4. **CRITICAL**: Maximum security with blocking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Adjust `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` environment variable
2. **CSRF Token Validation Failed**: Ensure `CSRF_SECRET_KEY` is properly set
3. **Input Validation Failed**: Check security level configuration

### Debugging

Enable debug logging for security events:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("acgs.security").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Constitutional Compliance

All security features maintain constitutional compliance with hash validation: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Security

#### Current Status

- ‚úÖ **curve25519-dalek**: Acknowledged Solana ecosystem limitation, properly documented and ignored
- ‚úÖ **No unsafe code**: All programs use safe Rust exclusively
- ‚úÖ **Constant-time operations**: Where cryptographically relevant
- ‚úÖ **Zero critical vulnerabilities**: Enterprise-grade security compliance achieved
- ‚úÖ **SLSA-Level 3 provenance**: Comprehensive security scanning and validation

#### Vulnerability Management

```toml
# Security patches applied in blockchain/Cargo.toml
[patch.crates-io]
# RUSTSEC-2022-0093: Fix oracle attack in ed25519-dalek
ed25519-dalek = { git = "https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek", rev = "1042cb60a07cdaacb59ca209716b69f444460f8f" }

# RUSTSEC-2024-0344: Fix timing variability in curve25519-dalek (when possible)
# Note: Limited by Solana SDK v1.18.26 dependency constraints
curve25519-dalek = { git = "https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek", tag = "curve25519-4.1.3" }
```

#### Enterprise Security Compliance

- **Zero-tolerance policy**: `cargo audit --ignore RUSTSEC-2024-0344 --deny warnings`
- **Comprehensive scanning**: Trivy, CodeQL, MSDO, Bandit, Safety
- **Automated remediation**: CI/CD pipeline with security gates
- **Regular audits**: Quarterly internal, annual external security reviews

### Program Security

#### Access Controls

- **Constitution Authority**: Controls constitutional changes and emergency actions
- **Policy Authority**: Manages policy creation and updates
- **Appeal Authority**: Handles appeal review and resolution
- **Upgrade Authority**: Controls program upgrades (can be revoked for immutability)

#### Multi-Signature Requirements

- **Constitutional Changes**: Requires 2-of-3 multi-signature approval
- **Emergency Actions**: Single authority with audit logging
- **Program Upgrades**: Dedicated upgrade authority keys

### Account Security

#### PDA (Program Derived Address) Usage

All program accounts use deterministic PDAs with appropriate seeds:

```rust
// Example PDA derivation
[b"constitution", authority.key().as_ref()]
[b"policy", policy_id.as_bytes()]
[b"appeal", appellant.key().as_ref()]
```

#### Account Validation

- Ownership verification for all account modifications
- Signer validation for authority operations
- Cross-program invocation (CPI) security checks

## üîê Key Management

### Key Generation

Use the provided key management script:

```bash
./scripts/key_management.sh generate-governance
```

### Key Storage

- **Development**: Local filesystem with 600 permissions
- **Production**: Hardware security modules (HSMs) recommended
- **Backup**: Encrypted offline storage in multiple locations

### Authority Rotation

Regular authority key rotation schedule:

- **Program Upgrade Keys**: Every 6 months
- **Governance Keys**: Every 12 months
- **Emergency Keys**: Every 3 months

### Key Revocation

For immutable programs:

```bash
./scripts/key_management.sh revoke-program-authority <program_id> <authority_key>
```

## üß™ Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks
