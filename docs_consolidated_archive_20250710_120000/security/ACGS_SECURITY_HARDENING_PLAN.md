# ACGS Security Hardening Plan

**Constitutional Hash**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`  
**Current Security Score**: 95/100  
**Target Security Score**: 98/100  
**Gap Analysis**: 5-point improvement required  

## Executive Summary

This security hardening plan addresses the 5-point gap in the ACGS security assessment to achieve the target score of 98/100. The plan includes specific remediation actions, SBOM implementation, dependency monitoring, and post-quantum cryptography preparation.

## Current Security Assessment Analysis

### Identified Security Gaps (5 points)

Based on the comprehensive security assessment, the following areas require improvement:

1. **Dependency Vulnerability Management** (2 points)
   - Missing automated dependency scanning in CI/CD
   - No Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
   - Lack of defined patch SLA timelines

2. **Advanced Threat Protection** (1.5 points)
   - Limited post-quantum cryptography preparation
   - Missing advanced persistent threat (APT) detection
   - Insufficient zero-day vulnerability protection

3. **Security Monitoring and Response** (1 point)
   - Security incident response automation gaps
   - Limited security event correlation
   - Missing threat intelligence integration

4. **Constitutional Security Validation** (0.5 points)
   - Constitutional compliance under security stress testing
   - Security audit trail constitutional context validation
