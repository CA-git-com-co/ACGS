ACGS Architecture Documentation


<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->

Overview


This directory contains comprehensive architectural documentation for the Autonomous Constitutional Governance System (ACGS). It covers the high-level design, component interactions, data flows, and
 key architectural decisions that underpin the system's constitutional AI governance capabilities.

Key Architectural Principles


 - Microservices Architecture: Decoupled services for scalability and maintainability.
 - Constitutional Compliance: Every component and interaction adheres to the constitutional hash cdd01ef066bc6cf2.
 - Multi-Tenancy: Designed for secure and isolated operation across multiple tenants.
 - Event-Driven Design: Asynchronous communication for resilience and responsiveness.
 - Security by Design: Security considerations integrated from the outset.
 - Observability: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing for operational visibility.
