# ACGS-1 Workflow Transition & Deprecation Guide

<!-- Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2 -->


This guide provides complete instructions for transitioning from legacy workflows to modern unified workflows and safely deprecating old workflows.

## üéØ **Transition Overview**

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Modern workflows created** (4 new workflows)
- ‚úÖ **Vulnerability fixes applied** (238 vulnerabilities across 36 files)
- ‚úÖ **Branch protection guide created** (ready for when protection is enabled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Billing/quota issues** preventing workflow execution testing
- üîÑ **Legacy deprecation pending** (waiting for modern workflow validation)

### Modern Workflow Architecture

#### Primary Workflows
1. **`unified-ci-modern.yml`** - Main CI/CD pipeline
   - Smart change detection and conditional execution
   - UV package manager for 3x faster installs
   - Quality gates with 80-90% coverage targets
   - Multi-environment deployment support

2. **`security-focused.yml`** - Comprehensive security scanning
   - Zero-tolerance policy for critical vulnerabilities
   - Multi-tool scanning (Safety, Bandit, Semgrep, Trivy)
   - Daily automated scans
   - SARIF integration for GitHub Security tab

3. **`deployment-modern.yml`** - Environment-specific deployment
   - Blue-green deployment for production
   - Canary deployment for staging
   - Rolling updates for development
   - Automated rollback capabilities

4. **`solana-anchor.yml`** - Blockchain-specific validation
   - Rust security audits
   - Anchor program building and testing
   - Solana validator integration

## üöÄ **Safe Deprecation Process**

### Prerequisites Checklist
Before deprecating legacy workflows, ensure:

- [ ] GitHub Actions billing/quota issues resolved
- [ ] Modern workflows running successfully for at least 1 week
- [ ] Branch protection rules updated to use new workflow names
- [ ] Team notified of upcoming changes
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

### Step 1: Validate Modern Workflow Health

```bash
# Run the workflow monitoring script
python scripts/monitor_workflows.py

# Check for success rate > 80% for all modern workflows
```

### Step 2: Update Branch Protection Rules

```bash
# Run branch protection setup (when enabled)
python scripts/setup_branch_protection.py

# Or follow manual setup guide
cat BRANCH_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md
```

### Step 3: Execute Safe Deprecation

```bash
# First, run in dry-run mode to preview changes
python scripts/deprecate_legacy_workflows.py --dry-run

# If preview looks good, execute deprecation
python scripts/deprecate_legacy_workflows.py

# For emergency deprecation (skip health checks)
python scripts/deprecate_legacy_workflows.py --force
```

## üìä **Legacy Workflows to be Deprecated**

### Automatic Deprecation (Safe)
These workflows will be automatically deprecated:

- `ci-legacy.yml` - Replaced by `unified-ci-modern.yml`
- `security-comprehensive.yml` - Replaced by `security-focused.yml`
- `enhanced-parallel-ci.yml` - Functionality merged into unified pipeline
- `cost-optimized-ci.yml` - Optimizations included in modern workflows
- `optimized-ci.yml` - Replaced by more comprehensive modern workflows
- `ci-uv.yml` - UV functionality integrated into unified pipeline
- `enterprise-ci.yml` - Enterprise features included in modern workflows
- `ci.yml` - Original CI workflow (deprecated)
- `security.yml` - Original security workflow (deprecated)

### Manual Review Required
These workflows require manual evaluation before deprecation:

- `release.yml` - Check if release automation is still needed
- `publish.yml` - Verify package publishing requirements
- `pages.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment (if used)
- `dependabot.yml` - Automated dependency updates

## üîÑ **Migration Mapping**

### Functionality Migration Table

| Legacy Workflow | Modern Replacement | Key Improvements |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| `ci-legacy.yml` | `unified-ci-modern.yml` | UV package manager, smart change detection |
| `security-comprehensive.yml` | `security-focused.yml` | Zero-tolerance policy, SARIF integration |
| `enhanced-parallel-ci.yml` | `unified-ci-modern.yml` | Better parallelization, conditional execution |
| `cost-optimized-ci.yml` | All modern workflows | Built-in cost optimization |
| `deploy.yml` | `deployment-modern.yml` | Multi-environment strategies |

### Required Status Check Updates

Replace these legacy checks in branch protection:
```yaml
# OLD (remove these)
- ci-legacy.yml
- security-comprehensive.yml
- enhanced-parallel-ci.yml

# NEW (add these)
- quality-gates
- security-summary
- blockchain-validation
- container-security
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rollback Procedures**

### If Modern Workflows Fail

1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   # Copy workflow from archive
   cp .github/workflows/deprecated/ci-legacy.yml .github/workflows/

   # Remove deprecation notice from file header
   # Update GitHub Actions versions if needed
   ```

2. **Emergency Rollback Script**
   ```bash
   # Restore all legacy workflows
   cp .github/workflows/deprecated/*.yml .github/workflows/

   # Update branch protection to use legacy workflow names
   # Notify team of rollback
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback Actions**
   - Investigate root cause of modern workflow failures
   - Fix issues in modern workflows
   - Plan re-migration timeline
   - Document lessons learned

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Single workflow failure | Fix specific workflow | 1-2 hours |
| Multiple workflow failures | Partial rollback | 4-6 hours |
| Complete pipeline failure | Full rollback | Immediate |
| Security scan failures | Continue with warnings | Monitor closely |

## üìã **Post-Deprecation Checklist**

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
- [ ] Verify all modern workflows running successfully
- [ ] Confirm branch protection rules updated
- [ ] Check that no builds are blocked
- [ ] Monitor for any regression issues

### Short-term Actions (Week 1)
- [ ] Team training on new workflow structure
- [ ] Update CI/CD documentation
- [ ] Remove legacy workflow references from README
- [ ] Clean up old workflow run history (optional)

### Long-term Actions (Month 1)
- [ ] Performance comparison analysis
- [ ] Cost optimization review
- [ ] Team feedback collection
- [ ] Process improvement recommendations

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Considerations**
