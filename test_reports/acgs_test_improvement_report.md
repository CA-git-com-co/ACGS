## Technical Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Real Service Integration**
```python
# Before: Mock implementations
class MockConstitutionalService:
    async def validate_policy(self, policy):
        return {"compliant": True}

# After: Real service integration
from services.core.constitutional_ai.ac_service.app.services.constitutional_compliance_engine import (
    ConstitutionalComplianceEngine,
)
```

### 2. **Proper Async Mocking**
```python
# Before: Incorrect async mocking
mock_client.get.return_value = Mock(status_code=200)

# After: Proper async mocking
mock_client.get = AsyncMock(return_value=mock_response)
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Test Configuration**
- Added `tests/conftest.py` with proper fixtures
- Configured pytest with asyncio support
- Set up proper environment variables
- Added constitutional compliance validation
