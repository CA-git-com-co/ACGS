```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.75.0+ (for Anchor programs)
- **Solana CLI** 1.18.22+ (for blockchain development)
- **Anchor CLI** 0.29.0+ (for smart contract framework)
- **Node.js** 18+ (for TypeScript/React development)
- **Python** 3.11+ (for backend services)
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (for containerization)

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CA-git-com-co/ACGS.git
   cd ACGS-1
   ```

2. **Install Solana & Anchor** (for blockchain development):
   ```bash
   # Install Solana CLI
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.22/install)"

   # Install Anchor CLI
   cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
   avm install 0.29.0
   avm use 0.29.0
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment** (for backend services):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Node.js dependencies** (for frontend applications):

  run: docker build ./services/core/constitutional-ai/ac_service
```

### 5. Update Documentation References

- Replace `src/backend/` with `services/`
- Replace `quantumagi_core/` with `blockchain/`
- Update API endpoint documentation
- Update deployment guide references

## 🧪 Testing Your Migration

### 1. Verify Service Startup

```bash
# Test core services
cd services/core/constitutional-ai && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001
cd services/core/governance-synthesis && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8002

# Test platform services
cd services/platform/authentication && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
cd services/platform/integrity && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8005
```

### 2. Verify Blockchain Programs

```bash
cd blockchain
anchor test
```

### 3. Verify Frontend Applications

```bash
cd applications/governance-dashboard
npm start
```

### 4. Run Full Test Suite

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## 🔧 Common Migration Issues

### Import Errors

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.backend'`

**Solution**: Update import statements to use new paths:
```python
# Change this
from services.core.backend.shared.models import User

# To this
from services.shared.models import User
```

### Docker Build Failures

**Problem**: `COPY failed: file not found`

**Solution**: Update Dockerfile paths:
```dockerfile
# Change this
COPY src/backend/shared /app/shared

# To this
COPY services/shared /app/shared
```

### Test Failures

**Problem**: Tests can't find modules or files

**Solution**: Update test imports and file paths:
```python
# Update test imports
from services.core.constitutional_ai.ac_service.app.main import app

# Update test file paths
test_file = "services/shared/test_data/sample.json"
```

### Anchor Program Issues

**Problem**: `anchor build` fails

**Solution**: Ensure you're in the `blockchain/` directory:
```bash
cd blockchain
anchor build
```
